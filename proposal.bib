  abstract = {A protocol defines how systems communicate. There are two ways of
	
	specifying the protocol, the language of communication. One way is
	
	to specify the automaton that recognizes the language, and this is
	
	the approach taken by SDL, etc. The other more abstract way ss to
	
	specify the grammar of the language and let a tool synthesize the
	
	automaton. Directly specifying the automaton makes the specification
	
	implementation dependent in two ways: the time behavior is specified
	
	in terms of states, and the width of the inputs and outputs is fixed.
	
	By specifying the grammar, the specification is potentially independent
	
	of both these implementation details and allows design space exploration
	
	in these dimensions. This paper presents a grammar-based language,
	
	called Program, that supports a port-size independent specifications
	
	methodology and its application to parts of the Operation and Maintenance
	
	protocol, a typical application from the ATM world. The methodology

	First, PICO splits the specified system design space into smaller

	PICO reduces the design exploration time by over four orders of magnitude

  abstract = {Automated design tools help to capture the benefits of customization
	
	in embedded system design while not exceeding design budgets. Such
	
	design tools must understand and exploit the hierarchical structure
	
	of design spaces, because systems of any significant complexity typically
	
	consist of components (subsystems). In order to reduce the design
	
	cost for such systems, designers develop the best component designs
	
	and restrict the number of system designs that they evaluate to those
	
	formed by combining these component designs.
	
	
	This report formalizes this overall approach. A decomposition splits
	
	a system design space into smaller design spaces, one for each of

	composition of component designs is a valid system design. We develop
	
	efficient ways to filter component designs from further consideration

	all valid designs. Finally, we employ component-level evaluation
	
	functions to generate high quality component designs. We show how
	
	these results were applied in the automated design of an embedded

  abstract = {We propose techniques for identifying and exploiting spatial and temporal
	
	reuse for indirectly indexed arrays. Indirectly indexed arrays are
	
	those arrays which are, typically, accessed inside multilevel loop
	
	nests and whose index expression includes not only loop iterators
	
	and constants but arrays as well. Existing techniques for improving
	
	locality are quite sophisticated in the case of directly indexed
	
	arrays. But, unfortunately, they are inadequate for handling indirectly
	
	indexed arrays. In this article we therefore extend the existing
	
	framework and techniques of directly indexed to indirectly indexed
	
	arrays. The concepts of reuse subspace, dependence vector, self,
	
	and group reuse are extended and applied in this new context. Also,
	
	lately scratch-pad memory has become an attractive alternative to
	
	data-cache, specially in the embedded multimedia community. This
	
	is because embedded systems are very sensitive to area and energy
	
	and the scratch-pad is smaller in area and consumes less energy on
	
	a per access basis compared to the cache of the same capacity. Several
	
	techniques have been proposed in the past for the efficient exploitation
	
	of the scratch-pad for directly indexed arrays. We extend these techniques
	
	by presenting a method for scratch-pad mapping of indirectly indexed
	
	arrays. This enables the scratch-pad to be used in a larger context
	
	than was possible before.},

	(or networks on chip) has become an increasingly important component
	
	of computer architecture. The Cell Broadband Engine's Element Interconnect
	
	Bus (EIB), with its four data rings and shared command bus for end-to-end
	
	control, supports twelve nodes--more than most mainstream on-chip
	
	networks, which makes it an interesting case study. As a first step
	
	toward understanding the design and performance of on-chip networks

	proposed 5-tuple latency characterization model for on-chip networks.
	
	These are used to identify the end-to-end control component of the
	
	EIB (i.e., the shared command bus) as being the main bottleneck to
	
	achieving minimal, single-cycle latency and maximal 307.2 GB/sec

	exacerbated by poorly designed Cell software, which can have significant

	study are that the end-to-end control of the EIB influenced by software
	
	running on the Cell has inherent scaling problems and serves as the
	
	main limiter to overall network performance. Thus, end-to-end effects
	
	must not be overlooked when designing efficient networks on chip.},

	evaluate the performance of uniprocessor and multiprocessor system
	
	designs. This paper identifies performance variability as a potentially
	
	major challenge for architectural simulation studies using these
	
	workloads. Variability refers to the differences between multiple
	
	estimates of a workload's performance. Time variability occurs when
	
	a workload exhibits different characteristics during different phases
	
	of a single run. Space variability occurs when small variations in
	
	timing cause runs starting from the same initial condition to follow
	
	widely different execution paths. Variability is a well-known phenomenon
	
	in real systems, but is nearly universally ignored in simulation
	
	experiments. In a central result of this paper we show that variability
	
	in multi-threaded commercial workloads can lead to incorrect architectural
	
	conclusions (e.g., 31\% of the time in one experiment). We propose
	
	a methodology, based on multiple simulations and standard statistical
	
	techniques, to compensate for variability. Our methodology greatly
	
	reduces the probability of reaching incorrect conclusions, while
	
	enabling simulations to finish within reasonable time limits.},

	wavelet transform (ODWT) subbands from the critically sampled DWT
	
	subbands (complete representation). This complete-to-overcomplete
	
	DWT (CODWT) has certain advantages in comparison to the conventional
	
	approach that performs the inverse DWT to reconstruct the input signal,
	
	followed by the a/spl grave/-trous or the lowband shift algorithm.
	
	Specifically, the computation of the input signal is not required.
	
	As a result, the minimum number of downsampling operations is performed
	
	and the use of upsampling is avoided. The proposed CODWT computes
	
	the ODWT subbands by using a set of prediction-filter matrices and
	
	filtering-and-downsampling operators applied to the DWT. This formulation
	
	demonstrates a clear separation between the single-rate and multirate
	
	components of the transform. This can be especially significant when
	
	the CODWT is used in resource-constrained environments, such as resolution-scalable
	
	image and video codecs. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed
	
	transform in these emerging applications, a new scheme for the transform-calculation
	
	is proposed, and existing coding techniques that benefit from its
	
	usage are surveyed. The analysis of the proposed CODWT in terms of
	
	arithmetic complexity and delay reveals significant gains as compared

	history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore
	
	designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary
	
	compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to
	
	double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation.
	
	
	
	A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years
	
	to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach
	
	to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor
	
	systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor
	
	systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level
	
	parallelism.
	
	
	
	We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism
	
	at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing
	
	and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel
	
	landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following:
	
	
	
	-- The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs
	
	that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems.
	
	
	
	-- The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are
	
	built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS
	
	(Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon,
	
	and MIPS per development dollar.
	
	
	
	-- Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and
	
	evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf
	
	is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and
	
	communication.)
	
	
	
	-- "Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers
	
	in translating parallel programs.
	
	
	
	-- To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models
	
	must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware
	
	or applications.
	
	
	
	-- To be successful, programming models should be independent of the
	
	number of processors.
	
	
	
	-- To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support
	
	a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism:
	
	task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism.
	
	
	
	-- Architects should not include features that significantly affect
	
	performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their
	
	impact via performance counters and energy counters.
	
	
	
	-- Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating
	
	system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual
	
	machines.
	
	
	
	-- To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based
	
	on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable
	
	and low cost.
	
	
	
	Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware
	
	is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system
	
	software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel.
	
	Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones
	
	of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of
	
	highly parallel systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Disydent, a framework dedicated to system-on-a-chip
	
	(SoC) platform-based design for shared memory multiple instructions
	
	multiple data (MIMD) architectures. We define a platform-based design
	
	problem as a triplet (system, application, constraints) where the
	
	system is both an operating system (OS) and a hardware (HW) template
	
	that can be enhanced with dedicated coprocessors. Our contributions
	
	are: 1) the definition of a complete flow for platform-based design,
	
	from application to integration including all necessary intermediate
	
	steps and 2) a set of tightly bound operational tools to implement
	
	the flow. Disydent is based on four tools. The distributed process
	
	network (DPN) is a C library for describing Kahn process network
	
	(KPN)-based applications. The asynchronous serial interface mode
	
	register 0 (ASIM0) is a multiprocessor target platform running a
	
	microkernel. This platform can be enhanced with coprocessors generated
	
	by the user-guided high-level synthesis (UGH) tool. Cycle accurate
	
	system simulator (CASS) is a high-performance cycle-accurate simulator.
	
	The main steps of the design flow are KPN modeling, functional validation,
	
	design space exploration, high-level synthesis, and temporal validation.
	
	The design flow starts by modeling the application as a KPN. This
	
	initial description is done in C using the DPN library. The functional
	
	validation is performed by running the initial description directly
	
	on the host. Without modifying the initial description, the user
	
	can simulate a HW/software (SW) partitioning by indicating the number
	
	of processors and the processes that are to be migrated to HW. This
	
	simulation is done at the cycle-accurate level for the whole system,
	
	except for the migrated processes for which the user must provide
	
	estimated time models. The description of the processes that are
	
	selected for HW implementation must be translated into a subset of
	
	C and then synthesized. This new description is still compatible
	
	with the DPN library, so it can be used for functional validation.
	
	The temporal validation is done at the cycle-accurate level using
	
	the initial description for the SW processes and cycle-accurate models
	
	automatically generated from the C subset description for the HW
	
	processes. Disydent's strength relies on its formal- KPN model that
	
	ensures a behavior that is independent of the overall system scheduling,
	
	its fast cycle-accurate validation that is several orders of magnitude
	
	faster than classical event-driven simulators, and its single description
	
	of a process that is used as input of DPN, CASS, and UGH.},

	However, standard techniques such as full just-in-time(JIT) compilation

	system, targeted for resource-constrained environments, that achieves
	
	runtime performance similar to that of state-of-the-art JIT/AO systems,
	
	while having a minimal impact on runtime memory consumption. The
	
	key ideas are to use profiler-selected, extended bytecode basic blocks
	
	as superoperators (new bytecode instructions) and to perform few,
	
	but very targeted, JIT/AO-like optimizations at compile time only
	
	on the superoperatorsÂ bytecode, as directed by compilation ÂhintsÂ
	
	encoded as annotations. As such, our system achieves competitive
	
	performance to a JIT/AO system, but with a much lower impact on runtime
	
	memory consumption. Moreover, it is shown that our proposed system
	
	can further improve program performance by selectively inlining method
	
	calls embedded in the chosen superoperators, as directed by runtime
	
	profiling data and with minimal impact on classfile size. For experimental
	
	evaluation, we developed three Virtual Machines( VMs) that employ
	
	the ideas presented above. The customized VMs are first compared
	
	(w.r.t. runtime performance) to a simple, fast-to-develop VM (baseline)
	
	and then to a VM that employs JIT/AO. Our best-performing system
	
	attains speedups ranging from a factor of 1.52 to a factor of 3.07,
	
	w.r.t. to the baseline VM. When compared to a state-of-the-art JIT/AO
	
	VM, our proposed system performs better for three of the benchmarks
	
	and worse by less than a factor of 2 for three others. But our SO-extended
	
	VM outperforms the JIT/AO system by a factor of 16, on average, w.r.t.

	fragments of imperative languages like C, C++, Java and Python is
	
	a challenging problem. In this paper, we consider a core imperative
	
	language that has several features found in mainstream languages

	user-defined exceptions, and a realistic data and memory model. For
	
	this language we provide a concrete semantics ---characterizing both
	
	finite and infinite computations--- and a generic abstract semantics
	
	that we prove sound with respect to the concrete one. We say the
	
	abstract semantics is generic since it is designed to be completely
	
	parametric on the analysis domains: in particular, it provides support
	
	for \emph{relational} domains (i.e., abstract domains that can capture
	
	the relationships between different data objects). We also sketch
	
	how the proposed methodology can be extended to accommodate a larger

	control flow mechanisms. The approach, which is based on structured,
	
	big-step $\mathrm{G}^\infty\mathrm{SOS}$ operational semantics and
	
	on abstract interpretation, is modular in that the overall static
	
	analyzer is naturally partitioned into components with clearly identified

	by allowing for the representation of finite disjunctions of its
	
	elements. While most of the operations on the finite powerset abstract
	
	domain are easily obtained by ``lifting'' the corresponding operations
	
	on the base-level domain, the problem of endowing finite powersets
	
	with a provably correct widening operator is still open. In this
	
	paper we define three generic widening methodologies for the finite
	
	powerset abstract domain. The widenings are obtained by lifting any
	
	widening operator defined on the base-level abstract domain and are
	
	parametric with respect to the specification of a few additional
	
	operators that allow all the flexibility required to tune the complexity/precision
	
	trade-off. As far as we know, this is the first time that the problem
	
	of deriving non-trivial, provably correct widening operators in a
	
	domain refinement is tackled successfully. We illustrate the proposed
	
	techniques by instantiating our widening methodologies on powersets
	
	of convex polyhedra, a domain for which no non-trivial widening operator
	
	was previously known.},

	performance of a native instruction stream as it executes on the
	
	processor. The input native instruction stream to Dynamo can be dynamically
	
	generated (by a JIT for example), or it can come from the execution
	
	of a statically compiled native binary. This paper evaluates the
	
	Dynamo system in the latter, more challenging situation, in order
	
	to emphasize the limits, rather than the potential, of the system.
	
	Our experiments demonstrate that even statically optimized native
	
	binaries can be accelerated Dynamo, and often by a significant degree.
	
	For example, the average performance of -O optimized SpecInt95 benchmark
	
	binaries created by the HP product C compiler is improved to a level
	
	comparable to their -O4 optimized version running without Dynamo.
	
	Dynamo achieves this by focusing its efforts on optimization opportunities
	
	that tend to manifest only at runtime, and hence opportunities that
	
	might be difficult for a static compiler to exploit. Dynamo's operation
	
	is transparent in the sense that it does not depend on any user annotations
	
	or binary instrumentation, and does not require multiple runs, or
	
	any special compiler, operating system or hardware support. The Dynamo
	
	prototype presented here is a realistic implementation running on
	
	an HP PA-8000 workstation under the HPUX 10.20 operating system.},

	simple local control elements which take control over the activeness
	
	of each attached processor element. Each control element thereby
	
	propagates a ``start" and a ``stop execution" signal to its neighbors.
	
	We show that our control mechanism is much more efficient than existing
	
	approaches because 1) only two control signals (start/stop) are required,
	
	2) no extension of the computation space is necessary. 3) By the
	
	local propagation of just one start/stop signal, energy is saved
	
	as processing elements are only active between the time they have
	
	received the start signal and the time they have received the stop
	
	signal. Our methodology is applicable to one- and multi-dimensional
	
	processor arrays and is based on local control signal propagation.
	
	We provide a theoretical analysis of the overhead caused by the control
	
	structure.},

	This paper presents a novel sample-based method for analyzing the
	
	data locality of a multithreaded application. Very sparse data is
	
	collected during a single execution of the studied application. The
	
	architectural-independent information collected during the execution

	data locality with respect to almost any possible memory system,
	
	such as complicated multiprocessor multilevel cache hierarchies.
	
	Any combination of cache size, cache-line size and degree of sharing
	
	can be modeled. Each modeled design point takes only a fraction of

	the tool not just usable for software developers, but also for hardware

	with application-specific hardware accelerators can lead to a significant
	
	performance improvement. Our hybrid architecture uses a Java Virtual
	
	Machine as an abstraction layer to hide the complexity of the hardware/software
	
	interface between processor and accelerator from the programmer.
	
	The data communication between the accelerator and the processor
	
	often incurs a significant cost, which sometimes annihilates the
	
	original speedup obtained by the accelerator. This article shows
	
	how we minimise this communication cost by dynamically choosing an
	
	optimal data layout in the Java heap memory which is distributed
	
	over both the accelerator and the processor memory. The proposed
	
	self-learning memory allocation strategyfinds the optimal location
	
	for each Java object`s data by means of runtime profiling. The communication
	
	cost is effectively reduced by up to 86% for the benchmarks in the

	can be performed with regards to communication, a significant performance
	
	boost can be obtained. But to do this effectively, communication
	
	streams inside the application must be known. In this paper, we introduce
	
	a profiling tool for {Java} that can measure data flows between methods.
	
	It constructs a communication graph, which combines a traditional
	
	call graph with data flow information. The overhead of profiling
	
	is brought down by a factor of 15 through the use of reservoir sampling.
	
	We prove that this can be done with a limited decrease in accuracy.

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to facilitate hardware
	
	
	design. One of the first design decisions is the partitioning
	
	
	of the system in smaller subsystems, which can be
	
	
	implemented on separate hardware and/or software components.
	
	
	Internal communication within components and external
	
	
	communication between different components can be
	
	
	distinguished. Especially external communication is cumbersome,
	
	
	because it determines the requirements for the
	
	
	communication channels in the system. Distinction between
	
	
	internal and external communication is defined by the functional
	
	
	partitioning step which thus has a major impact on
	
	
	the quality of the final design. By estimating communication
	
	
	between functions in advance, we enable a better functional
	
	
	partitioning and therefore improve the communication requirements
	
	
	in the system. As in [4], Java is used in this paper
	
	
	as a specification language for the system, because this language
	
	
	is ideally fit for communication analysis. We present a
	
	
	profiler which measures communication between methods in
	
	
	Java. Our profiler counts the so called consumer-producer
	
	
	relations for each pair of methods. Each consumer-producer
	
	
	relation is defined as a pair of a read operation from and
	
	
	the corresponding write operation to the Java heap memory.
	
	
	The profiling requires a huge increase in execution
	
	
	time. To reduce this overhead, we implement reservoir sampling
	
	
	[11]. This sampling method randomly and uniformly
	
	
	selects a smaller set of read operations to be profiled. The
	
	
	size of this set, i.e. the reservoir, specifies the sampling accuracy.
	
	
	Our approach is evaluated on the SPECjvm98 benchmark
	
	
	suite. The sampling technique reduces the overhead
	
	
	by a factor of 15. Yet accuracy remains within pre-specified
	
	
	limits.},

	locality. Improving temporal locality implies reducing the distance
	
	of data reuses that are far apart. The best existing tools indicate
	
	locality bottlenecks by highlighting both the source locations generating
	
	the use and the subsequent cache-missing reuse. Even with this knowledge
	
	of the bottleneck locations in the source code, it often remains
	
	hard to find an effective code refactoring that improves temporal
	
	locality, due to the unclear interaction of function calls and loop
	
	iterations occurring between use and reuse.
	
	
	The contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, the locality
	
	analysis is enhanced to not only pinpoint the cache bottlenecks,
	
	but to also suggest code refactorings that may resolve them. The
	
	refactorings are found by analyzing the dynamic hierarchy of function
	
	calls and loops on the code path between reuses, called reuse paths.
	
	Secondly, reservoir sampling of the reuse paths results in a significant
	
	reduction of the execution time and memory requirements during profiling,
	
	enabling the analysis of realistic programs.
	
	
	An interactive GUI, called SLO (Suggestions for Locality Optimizations),
	
	has been used to explore the most appropriate refactorings in a number
	
	of SPEC2000 programs. After refactoring, the execution time of the

	and the next use of the same data, which we call the Intermediately
	
	Executed Code (IEC). The first tool, the Reuse Distance VISualizer
	
	(RDVIS), performs a clustering on the IECs, which reduces the amount

	due to the lack of dedicated, high-level tools. In this paper we
	
	present a novel instrumentation framework that supports the partial
	
	evaluation of compiled {Java} code transformation templates, with
	
	the goal of efficiently measuring chosen dynamic bytecode and control
	
	flow metrics. This framework, as well as the instrumentation code
	
	it generates, is implemented in pure {Java} and hence completely
	
	platform-independent. We show the benefits of our approach in several
	
	application areas, such as platform-independent resource management

  abstract = {{Java} bytecode instrumentation is a widely used technique, especially
	
	for profiling purposes. In order to ensure the instrumentation of
	
	all classes in the system, including dynamically generated or downloaded
	
	code, instrumentation has to be performed at runtime. The standard
	
	JDK offers some mechanisms for dynamic instrumentation, which however
	
	either require the use of native code or impose severe restrictions
	
	on the instrumentation of certain core classes of the JDK. These
	
	limitations prevent several instrumentation techniques that are important
	
	for efficient, calling context-sensitive profiling. In this paper
	
	we present a generic bytecode instrumentation framework that goes
	
	beyond these restrictions and enables the customized, dynamic instrumentation
	
	of all classes in pure {Java}. Our framework addresses important
	
	issues, such as bootstrapping an instrumented JDK, as well as avoiding
	
	measurement perturbations due to dynamic instrumentation or execution
	
	of instrumentation code. We validated and evaluated our framework
	
	using an instrumentation for exact profiling which generates complete
	
	calling context trees of various platform-independent dynamic metrics.},

	architectures achieve large degrees of parallelism. However, loop
	
	unrolling increases the area and can potentially have a negative
	
	impact on clock cycle time. In most embedded applications, the critical
	
	parameter is the throughput. Loop unrolling can therefore have contradictory
	
	effects on the throughput. As a consequence there exists, in general,
	
	a degree of unrolling that maximizes the throughput per unit area.
	
	
	
	This paper studies the effect of loop unrolling on the area, clock
	
	speed and throughput within the ROCCC, C to VHDL compilation framework.
	
	Our results indicate that due to the unique design of the ROCCC compilation
	
	framework, {FPGA} area either shrinks or increases at a very low
	
	rate for the first few times the loops are unrolled. This reduced
	
	area causes the clock cycle time to decrease and thus a great gain
	
	in throughput. Our results also show that there are different optimal
	
	unrolling factors for different programs.},

	our lives. The most challenging designs are safety-critical systems,
	
	such as transportation systems (e.g., airplanes, cars, and trains),
	
	industrial plants and health care monitoring. The difficulties reside
	
	in accommodating constraints both on functionality and implementation.
	
	The correct behavior must be guaranteed under diverse states of the
	
	environment and potential failures; implementation has to meet cost,
	
	size, and power consumption requirements. The design is therefore
	
	subject to extensive mathematical analysis and simulation. However,
	
	traditional models of information systems do not interface well to
	
	the continuous evolving nature of the environment in which these
	
	devices operate. Thus, in practice, different mathematical representations
	
	have to be mixed to analyze the overall behavior of the system. Hybrid
	
	systems are a particular class of mixed models that focus on the
	
	combination of discrete and continuous subsystems. There is a wealth
	
	of tools and languages that have been proposed over the years to
	
	handle hybrid systems. However, each tool makes different assumptions
	
	on the environment, resulting in somewhat different notions of hybrid
	
	system. This makes it difficult to share information among tools.
	
	Thus, the community cannot maximally leverage the substantial amount
	
	of work that has been directed to this important topic. In this paper,
	
	we review and compare hybrid system tools by highlighting their differences
	
	in terms of their underlying semantics, expressive power and mathematical
	
	mechanisms. We conclude our review with a comparative summary, which
	
	suggests the need for a unifying approach to hybrid systems design.
	
	As a step in this direction, we make the case for a semantic-aware
	
	interchange format, which would enable the use of joint techniques,
	
	make a formal comparison between different approaches possible, and
	
	facilitate exporting and importing design representations.},

	of compilation. Even more radical are systems that perform all compilation
	
	and optimization at run-time: such systems can optimize programs
	
	based on runtime program and system properties as well as static
	
	wholeprogram properties. However, run-time compilers (also called

	steals from time spent running the program. None of these compilation
	
	models dominates the others: each has unique strengths and weaknesses

	We are developing a new, staged compilation model which strives to
	
	combine high run-time code quality with low compilation overhead.
	
	Compilation is organized as a series of stages, with stages corresponding
	
	to, for example, separate compilation, library linking, program linking,
	
	and run-time execution. Any given optimization can be performed at
	
	any of these stages; to reduce compilation time while maintaining
	
	high effectiveness, an optimization should be performed at the earliest
	
	stage that provides the necessary program context information to
	
	carry out the optimization effectively. Moreover, a single optimization
	
	can itself be spread across multiple stages, with earlier stages
	
	performing preplanning work that enables the final stage to complete
	
	the optimization quickly. In this way, we hope to produce highly
	
	optimized programs, nearly as good as what could be done with a purely
	
	run-time compiler that had an unconstrained compilation time budget,
	
	but at a much more practical compile time cost.

	coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely

	can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the
	
	parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising,
	
	and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically,
	
	the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous
	
	to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining

	and works for general-purpose programs, including pointer-chasing
	
	codes written in weakly-typed languages, such as C and C++. It operates
	
	in three phases. First, the profiling phase gathers a temporal data
	
	reference profile from a running program with low-overhead. Next,
	
	the profiling is turned off and a fast analysis algorithm extracts
	
	hot data streams, which are data reference sequences that frequently
	
	repeat in the same order, from the temporal profile. Then, the system
	
	dynamically injects code at appropriate program points to detect
	
	and prefetch these hot data streams. Finally, the process enters
	
	the hibernation phase where no profiling or analysis is performed,
	
	and the program continues to execute with the added prefetch instructions.
	
	At the end of the hibernation phase, the program is de-optimized
	
	to remove the inserted checks and prefetch instructions, and control
	
	returns to the profiling phase. For long-running programs, this profile,
	
	analyze and optimize, hibernate, cycle will repeat multiple times.

	indicating overall execution time improvements of 5.19% for several

	computational capability is highly desirable. Achieving this goal
	
	using board-level copper interconnects in the future will become
	
	increasingly challenging owing to severe increase in high-frequency,
	
	skin-effect and dielectric loss, noise due to crosstalk, impedance
	
	mismatch, and package reflections. The solutions designed to overcome
	
	these deleterious effects require complex signal processing at the
	
	interconnect endpoints, which results in a larger power and area
	
	requirement. Optical interconnects offer a powerful alternative,
	
	potentially at a lower power. Prior work in comparing the two technologies
	
	has entailed overly simplified assumptions pertaining to either the
	
	optical or the electrical system. In this paper,we draw a more realistic
	
	power comparison with respect to the relevant parameters such as
	
	bandwidth, interconnect length and bit error rate (BER) by capturing
	
	the essential complexity in both types of interconnect systems. At
	
	the same time, we preserve the simplicity by using mostly analytical
	
	models, verified by SPICE simulations where possible. We also identify
	
	critical device and system parameters, which have a large effect
	
	on power dissipation in each type of interconnect, while quantifying
	
	the severity of their impact. For optical interconnect, these parameters
	
	are detector and modulator capacitance, responsivity, coupling efficiency
	
	and modulator type; whereas, in the case of electrical system, the
	
	critical parameters include receiver sensitivity/offset and impedance
	
	mismatch. Toward this end, we first present an optimization scheme
	
	to minimize optical interconnect power and quantify its performance
	
	as a function of future technology nodes. Next, on the electrical
	
	interconnect side, we examine the power dissipation of a state-of-the-art
	
	electrical interconnect, which uses simultaneous bidirectional signaling
	
	with transmitter equalization and on-chip noise cancellation. Finally,we
	
	draw extensive comparisons between optical and electrical interconnects.
	
	As an example, for bandwidth of 6 Gb/s at 100nmtechnology node, lengths
	
	greater than the critical length of about 43 cm yields lower power
	
	in optical interconnects. This length becomes lower (making optics
	
	more favorable) with higher data rates and lower bit error rate requirement.},

	While wavelet or subband coding of images has been shown to be superior
	
	to more traditional transform coding techniques, little attention
	
	has been paid until recently to the important issue of whether both
	
	the wavelet transforms and the subsequent coding can be implemented
	
	in low memory without significant loss in performance. We present
	
	a complete system to perform low memory wavelet image coding. Our
	
	approach is ?line-based? in that the images are read line by line
	
	and only the minimum required number of lines is kept in memory.
	
	There are two main contributions of our work. First, we introduce
	
	a line-based approach for the implementation of the wavelet transform,
	
	which yields the same results as a ?normal? implementation, but where,
	
	unlike prior work, we address memory issues arising from the need
	
	to synchronize encoder and decoder. Second, we propose a novel context-based
	
	encoder which requires no global information and stores only a local
	
	set of wavelet coefficients. This low memory coder achieves performance
	
	comparable to state of the art coders at a fraction of their memory

	that enable the user to decide whether DPR is suitable for a certain

	to calculate the expected reconfiguration throughput and latency.
	
	In addition, an IP core is presented that enables fast on-chip DPR
	
	close to the maximum achievable speed. Compared to an alternative
	
	state-of-the art realization, an increase in speed by a factor of
	
	58 can be obtained.},

	on silicon spatial light modulator (SLM) deposited with a 540x1 array
	
	of highly reflective and planar mirror strips. The input and output

	waveguide array and the single Fourier transform lens for the 2f
	
	holographic replay system are housed in an opto-mechanical mount
	
	to provide stability. The switch operates at 1.55 um wavelength and
	
	has a designed optical bandwidth of >60 nm. The first measured insertion
	
	loss and crosstalk figures are 16.9 dB and -19.1 dB, respectively.
	
	Improvements in SLM performance, the use of new addressing schemes
	
	and the introduction of better alignment techniques are expected
	
	to improve these figures considerably. The preliminary performance
	
	of a 3x3 optical crossconnect is also presented to show that this

	can lead to smaller memory requirements in the synthesis of dedicated
	
	processors or to more effective use by compiled code of software-controlled
	
	scratchpad memory. Memory reuse is well-understood for allocating
	
	registers to hold scalar variables. Its extension to arrays has been
	
	studied recently for multimedia applications, for loop parallelization,
	
	and for circuit synthesis from recurrence equations. In all such

	mapping (of loop or array indices to memory locations) achieves the
	
	desired reuse. We develop here a new mathematical framework, based
	
	on critical lattices, that subsumes the previous approaches and provides
	
	new insight. We first consider the set of indices that conflict,
	
	those that cannot be mapped to the same memory cell. Next, we construct
	
	the set of differences of conflicting indices. We establish a correspondence
	
	between a valid modular mapping and a strictly admissible integer
	
	lattice?one having no nonzero element in common with the set of conflicting
	
	index differences. The memory required by an optimal modular mapping
	
	is equal to the determinant of the corresponding lattice. The memory
	
	reuse problem is thus reduced to the (still interesting and nontrivial)
	
	problem of finding a strictly admissible integer lattice of least
	
	determinant. We then propose and analyze several practical strategies
	
	for finding strictly admissible integer lattices, either optimal
	
	or optimal up to a multiplicative factor, and, hence, memory-saving
	
	modular mappings. We explain and analyze previous approaches in terms

	wavelet transform or two band subband filtering with finite filters
	
	can be decomposed into a finite sequence of simple filtering steps,
	
	which we call lifting steps but that are also known as ladder structures.
	
	This decomposition corresponds to a factorization of the polyphase
	
	matrix of the wavelet or subband filters into elementary matrices.
	
	That such a factorization is possible is well-known to algebraists
	
	(and expressed by the formula SL(n;R[z,1/z]) = E(n; R[z,1/z])); it
	
	is also used in linear systems theory in the electrical engineering
	
	community. We present here a self-contained derivation, building
	
	the decomposition from basic principles such as the Euclidean algorithm,
	
	with a focus on applying it to wavelet filtering. This factorization
	
	provides an alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage
	
	that it can also be used in the biorthogonal, i.e, non-unitary case.
	
	Like the lattice factorization, the decomposition presented here
	
	asymptotically reduces the computational complexity of the transform
	
	by a factor two. It has other applications, such as the possibility
	
	of defining a wavelet-like transform that maps integers to integers.},

	systems increases, increased communication capability between distributed

	in using fiber optics to improve interconnect communication beyond
	
	that attainable using electronic technology. Several groups have

	we propose a fiber optic transceiver to provide low latency, high
	
	bandwidth channels for such interconnects using a robust multimode
	
	fiber technology. We use instruction-level simulation to quantify
	
	the bandwidth, latency, and concurrency required for such interconnects
	
	to scale to 256 nodes, each operating at I GFLOPS performance. We
	
	show that performance scales to &ap;100 GFLOPS for scientific application
	
	kernels using a small number of wavelengths (8 to 32), only one wavelength
	
	received per node, and achievable optoelectronic bandwidth and latency.},

	electrical interconnect. In this paper, we evaluate the option of
	
	using true source-synchronous signaling over optical interconnect
	
	with a large number of channels, reducing the substantial per-channel
	
	clock synchronization circuitry to one instance. We also look into
	
	dc-unbalanced signaling to remove the need for data coding. Uniformity
	
	across channels is key to the feasibility of such an approach. An
	
	actual 64-channel parallel optical interconnect setup at 1.25 Gb/s/channel
	
	is examined, and models for the performance and uniformity of the
	
	different constituent parts of the interconnect are drawn up. Major
	
	attention is given to the statistical modeling of the coupling efficiency
	
	between a vertical cavity surface emitting laser array and a multifiber
	
	connector. Although derived in the context of a uniformity study,
	
	the stochastic models and the modeling approach are valuable in their
	
	own right. In our case study, the usage of a common logic threshold
	
	across all channels, which is required for dc-unbalanced signaling,

	of reasonably-bounded execution time closer to developers who need
	
	such assurances for real-time and embedded systems applications.
	
	Recently, extensions to the {Java} libraries and virtual machine
	
	have been proposed in an emerging standard, which provides for specification
	
	of release times, execution costs, and deadlines for a restricted
	
	class of threads. To use such features, the code executing in the
	
	thread must never reference storage that could be subject to garbage
	
	collection. The new standard provides for regionlike, stack-allocated
	
	areas (scopes) of storage that are ignored by garbage collection
	
	and deallocated en masse. It now falls to the developer to adapt
	
	ordinary {Java} code to use the real-time {Java} scoped memory regions.
	
	Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine manually how to map object
	
	instantiations to scopes. Moreover, if ordinary {Java} code is modified
	
	to effect instantiations in scopes, the resulting code is difficult
	
	to read, maintain, and reuse. Static analysis can yield scopes that
	
	are correct across all program executions, but such analysis is necessarily
	
	conservative in nature. If too many objects appear to live forever
	
	under such analysis, then developers cannot rely on static analysis
	
	alone to form reasonable scopes. In this paper we present an approach
	
	for automatically determining appropriate storage scopes for {Java}
	
	objects, based on dynamic analysisÂobserved object lifetimes and
	
	object referencing behavior. While such analysis is perhaps unsafe
	
	across all program executions, our analysis can be coupled with static
	
	analysis to bracket object lifetimes, with the truth lying somewhere

  abstract = {When implementing multimedia applications, solutions in dedicated
	
	hardware are chosen only when the required performance or energy-efficiency
	
	cannot be met with a software solution. The performance of a hardware
	
	design critically depends upon having high levels of parallelism
	
	and data locality. Often a long sequence of high-level transformations
	
	is needed to sufficiently increase the locality and parallelism.
	
	The effect of the transformations is known only after translating
	
	the high-level code into a specific design at the circuit level.
	
	When the constraints are not met, hardware designers need to redo
	
	the high-level loop transformations, and repeat all subsequent translation
	
	steps, which leads to long design times.
	
	
	We propose a method to reduce design time through the synergistic
	
	combination of techniques (a) to quickly pinpoint the loop transformations
	
	that increase locality; (b) to refactor loops in a polyhedral model
	
	and check whether a sequence of refactorings is legal; (c) to generate
	
	efficient structural VHDL from the optimized refactored algorithm.
	
	
	The implementation of these techniques in a tool suite results in
	
	a far shorter design time of hours instead of days or weeks. A 2D-inverse
	
	discrete wavelet transform was taken as a case study. The results
	
	outperform those of a commercial C-to-VHDL compiler, and compare
	
	favorably with existing published approaches.},

  abstract = {Multimedia applications are examples of a class of algorithms that
	
	are both calculation and data intensive and have real-time requirements.
	
	As a result dedicated hardware acceleration is often needed. Usually
	
	the on-chip memory is not sufficient to store all data and has to
	
	be extended with external memory. The bandwidth to this memory often
	
	becomes a bottle neck. Loop transformations are needed to reduce
	
	this bandwidth, by improving the temporal and spatial data locality.
	
	They can also unveil the parallelism present in the algorithm. The
	
	polyhedral model offers a flexible program representation that allows
	
	to automate this kind of transformations. The class of applications
	
	that can be transformed with the polyhedral model fits very well
	
	into the class of applications that can benefit from hardware acceleration.
	
	This paper describes how the existing tools, that generate software
	
	from a polyhedral program representation, have been extended to generate
	
	a VHDL description of a hardware controller. The corresponding data
	
	path is generated semi-automatically. Combining the generation of
	
	controller and data path creates a fast path to hardware. Our techniques
	
	enable an easy exploration of the design space, by generating a lot
	
	of implementation variants. The techniques are demonstrated on an
	
	inverse discrete wavelet transform resulting in several synthesizable
	
	designs, of which one has been hand-optimized towards a {FPGA} implementation.
	
	The results outperform those of a commercial C-to-VHDL compiler.
	
	The generated variants run 5 to 10 times faster while consuming less
	
	resources.},

	computer systems. An effective strategy is to group computations
	
	on the same data so that once the data are loaded into cache, the
	
	program performs all their operations before the data are evicted.
	
	However, computation regrouping is difficult to automate for programs
	
	with complex data and control structures. This paper studies the
	
	potential of locality improvement through trace-driven computation
	
	regrouping. First, it shows that maximizing the locality is different
	
	from maximizing the parallelism or maximizing the cache utilization.
	
	The problem is NP-hard even without considering data dependences
	
	and cache organization. Then the paper describes a tool that performs
	
	constrained computation regrouping on program traces. The new tool
	
	is unique because it measures the exact control dependences and applies
	
	complete memory renaming and re-allocation. Using the tool, the paper

  abstract = {High Level Synthesis Controled by the User
	
	
	
	The high level synthesis for dedicated coprocessor is a very complex
	
	problem. It has to cope with different aims like the working frequency,
	
	the surface, the consumption, etc... These criteria specify the generated
	
	circuit and the high level synthesis tool efficiency. This Ph.D thesis
	
	presents a two steps approach in the high level synthesis. In the
	
	first step, we minimize the surface and maximize the parallelism.
	
	In the second step, the circuit is modified to take in account the
	
	electrical characteristics and to fetch the wanted working frequency.
	
	The synthesis tool has to optimize the circuit on a very few number
	
	of criteria which are specified by the designer. By the way, for
	
	the data control dominated circuits, the aim can't be qualified by
	
	a global guidance, because a such guidance is unadapted and can't
	
	qualify the optimization level. The collateral effects on the other
	
	characteristics of the circuit aren't controlled by the designer.
	
	The respect of the global guidance is difficult to reach by the synthesis
	
	algorithms. The scheduling, allocation and binding phases of the
	
	high level synthesis are NP-complex. Most of these problems are solved
	
	with heuristics which have unpredictable consequences on the circuit
	
	characteristics. The automation of the high level synthesis needs
	
	a very precise description of the designer's attempts. We are studying
	
	in this Ph.D thesis the necessary guidances to precisely aim a solution
	
	and keep the compatibility with our two-phases approach. We have
	
	to reduce the guidance definition to facilitate the designer's work
	
	and be aware of the loss of efficiency which has been induced.},

	and the corresponding architecture to be implemented in hardware.
	
	The objective of the proposal is to avoid the potential bottleneck

	CPU to graphics cards. The algorithm we propose is based on a layer
	
	strip representation method and a new data management that permits
	
	generation and efficient storage of the tessellated mesh. The corresponding
	
	architecture has to be included as an additional unit at the input
	
	of the graphics card. As a consequence, the transmission requirements
	
	from CPU to graphics card are greatly reduced as the tessellation
	
	is performed in the graphics card. On the other hand, the adaptive
	
	strategy employed permits selection of the number of triangles of
	
	the final mesh as a trade off between computational requirements
	
	and quality of the final mesh. The efficient data management proposed,
	
	together with the low storage requirements of the architecture, makes
	
	it a good candidate for its hardware implementation and inclusion

	Due to their special status within the language infrastructure, the
	
	<i>standard class libraries</i>, also known as <i>system classes</i>
	
	provided by most contemporary object-oriented languages are difficult

  abstract = {Scheduling a program (i.e. constructing a timetable for the execution
	
	of its operations) is one of the most powerful methods for automatic
	
	parallelization. A schedule gives a blueprint for constructing a
	
	synchronous program, suitable for an ASIC or a VLIW processor. However,
	
	constructing a schedule entails solving a large linear program. Even
	
	if one accepts the (experimental) fact that the Simplex is almost
	
	always polynomial, the scheduling time is of the order of a large
	
	power of the program size and of the maximum nesting level of its
	
	loops. Hence the method is not scalable. The present paper presents
	
	two methods for improving this situation. Firstly, a big program
	
	can be divided into smaller units (processes) which can be scheduled
	
	separately. This is modular scheduling. Second, one can use projection
	
	methods for solving linear programming problems incrementally. This
	
	is especially efficient if the dependence graph is sparse.},

	of interoctave dependencies but alone does not lead to efficient
	
	array solutions after the mapping due to limitations associated with
	
	transforming the three-dimensional (3-D) algorithm onto one-dimensional
	
	(1-D) arrays, which is also known as multiprojection. The second
	
	transformation is introduced to remove the need for multiprojection
	
	by formulating the regularized DWT algorithm in a two-dimensional
	
	(2-D) index space. Using this DWT formulation, we have synthesized
	
	two VLSI-amenable linear arrays of LPEs computing a 6-octave DWT
	
	decomposition with latencies of M and 2M-1, respectively, where L
	
	is the wavelet filter length, and M is the number of samples in the
	
	data sequence. The arrays are modular, regular, use simple control,
	
	and can be easily extended to larger L and J. The latency of both
	
	arrays is independent of the highest octave J, and the efficiency
	
	is nearly 100\% for any M with one design achieving the lowest possible
	
	latency of M},

	an integer linear programming (IP) problem and solving it optimally
	
	for general purpose processors and for dedicated embedded systems.
	
	Compared with traditional graph-coloring approaches, the IP-based
	
	allocators can improve a program's performance. However the solution
	
	times are much slower This paper presents an IP-based optimal register
	
	allocator which is much faster than previous work. We present several
	
	local and global reduction techniques to identify locations in a
	
	program's control-flow graph where spill decisions and register deallocation
	
	decisions are unnecessary for optimal register allocation. We propose
	
	a hierarchical reduction approach to efficiently remove the corresponding
	
	redundant decisions and constraints from the IP model. This allocator
	
	is built into the Gnu C Compiler and is evaluated experimentally
	
	using the SPEC92INT benchmarks. The results show that the improved
	
	IP model is much simpler The number of constraints produced is almost
	
	linear with the function size. The optimal allocation time is much
	
	faster with a speedup factor of about 150 for hard allocation problems.},

  abstract = {Java performance is far from being trivial to benchmark because it
	
	is affected by various factors such as the Java application, its
	
	input, the virtual machine, the garbage collector, the heap size,
	
	etc. In addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the execution
	
	time of a Java program to differ from run to run.There are a number
	
	of sources of non-determinism such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
	
	and optimization in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timer-based
	
	method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection, and various
	
	system effects. There exist a wide variety of Java performance evaluation
	
	methodologies used by researchers and benchmarkers. These methodologies
	
	differ from each other in a number of ways. Some report average performance
	
	over a number of runs of the same experiment; others report the best
	
	or second best performance observed; yet others report the worst.
	
	Some iterate the benchmark multiple times within a single VM invocation;
	
	others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate a single benchmark
	
	execution; yet others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate
	
	the benchmark multiple times. This paper shows that prevalent methodologies
	
	can be misleading, and can even lead to incorrect conclusions. The
	
	reason is that the data analysis is not statistically rigorous. In
	
	this paper, we present a survey of existing Java performance evaluation
	
	methodologies and discuss the importance of statistically rigorous
	
	data analysis for dealing with non-determinism. We advocate approaches
	
	to quantify startup as well as steady-state performance, and, in
	
	addition, we provide the JavaStats software to automatically obtain
	
	performance numbers in a rigorous manner. Although this paper focuses
	
	on Java performance evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this
	
	paper also apply to other programming languages and systems that
	
	build on a managed runtime system.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, real-time embedded systems have become much more
	
	complex due to the introduction of a lot of new functionality in
	
	one application, and due to running multiple applications concurrently.
	
	This increases the dynamic nature of today's applications and systems,
	
	and tightens the requirements for their constraints in terms of deadlines
	
	and energy consumption. State-of-the-art design methodologies try
	
	to cope with these novel issues by identifying several most used
	
	cases and dealing with them separately, reducing the newly introduced
	
	complexity. This article presents a generic and systematic design-time/run-time
	
	methodology for handling the dynamic nature of modern embedded systems,
	
	which can be utilized by existing design methodologies to increase
	
	their efficiency. It is based on the concept of system scenarios,
	
	which group system behaviors that are similar from a multidimensional
	
	cost perspectiveÂsuch as resource requirements, delay, and energy
	
	consumptionÂin such a way that the system can be configured to exploit
	
	this cost similarity. At design-time, these scenarios are individually
	
	optimized. Mechanisms for predicting the current scenario at run-time,
	
	and for switching between scenarios, are also derived. This design
	
	trajectory is augmented with a run-time calibration mechanism, which
	
	allows the system to learn on-the-fly during its execution, and to
	
	adapt itself to the current input stimuli, by extending the scenario
	
	set, changing the scenario definitions, and both the prediction and
	
	switching mechanisms. To show the generality of our methodology,
	
	we show how it has been applied on four very different real-life
	
	design problems. In all presented case studies, substantial energy
	
	reductions were obtained by exploiting scenarios.},

	for improving software performance and power. The first step in dynamic
	
	optimization consists of detecting frequently executed code, or critical
	
	regions. Most previous critical region detectors have been targeted
	
	to desktop processors. We introduce a critical region detector targeted
	
	to embedded processors, with the unique features of being very size
	
	and power efficient and being completely nonintrusive to the software's
	
	executionÃ¯Â¿Åfeatures needed in timing-sensitive embedded systems.
	
	Our detector not only finds the critical regions, but also determines
	
	their relative frequencies, a potentially important feature for selecting
	
	among alternative dynamic optimization methods. Our detector uses
	
	a tiny cache-like structure coupled with a small amount of logic.
	
	We provide results of extensive explorations across 19 embedded system
	
	benchmarks. We show that highly accurate results can be achieved
	
	with only a 0.02 percent power overhead, acceptable size overhead,
	
	and zero runtime overhead. Our detector is currently being used as
	
	part of a dynamic hardware/software partitioning approach, but is
	
	applicable to a wide variety of situations.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces methods for extending the classical systolic
	
	synthesis methodology to multidimensional time. Multi-dimensional
	
	scheduling enables complex algorithms that do not admit linear schedules
	
	to be parallelized, but it requires the use of memories in the architecture.
	
	The synthesis of such an architecture requires the definition of
	
	an allocation function that maps the calculations on the processors,
	
	and memory functions that define where the data are stored during
	
	execution. As our approach targets custom VLSI architectures, we
	
	constrain the synthesis method to produce parallel architectures
	
	that that satisfy the computer owns rule, i.e., each processor computes
	
	the data which are stored in its local memory. We explain how to
	
	combine the allocation and memory functions in order to meet the
	
	computer owns rule, and we present an original mechanism for controlling
	
	the operation of the architecture. We detail the different steps
	
	needed to generate a HDL description of the architecture, and we
	
	illustrate our method on the matrix multiplication algorithm. We
	
	describe a structural VHDL program that has been derived and synthesized
	
	for a {FPGA} platform using these design principles. Our results
	
	show that the complexity added in each processor by the memories
	
	and the control is moderate and justifies in practice the use of
	
	such architectures.},

	used in image processing, image compression, pattern recognition
	
	and digital signal processing. This problem is more acute in reconfigurable
	
	systems since the compiler must generate the data path and the sequence
	
	of operations. The challenge is to intelligently exploit data reuse
	
	on the reconfigurable fabric ({FPGA}) to minimize the required memory
	
	or I/O bandwidth while maximizing parallelism.In this paper, we present
	
	a compile-time approach to reuse data in window-based codes. The
	
	compiler, called ROCCC, first analyzes and optimizes the window operation
	
	in C. It then computes the size of the hardware buffer and defines
	
	three sets of data values for each window: the window set, the managed
	
	set and the killed set. This compile-time analysis simplifies the
	
	HDL code generation and improves the resulting hardware performance.

	presents an analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, at the architecture

	we experimentally analyze the remaining components of the speedup.
	
	We compare the performance of image processing application programs
	
	executing in hardware on a Xilinx Virtex E2000 {FPGA} to that on
	
	three general-purpose processor platforms: MIPS, Pentium III and
	
	VLIW. The question we set out to answer is what is the inherent advantage
	
	of a hardware implementation over a von Neumann platform. On the
	
	one hand, the clock frequency of general-purpose processors is about
	
	20 times that of typical {FPGA} implementations. On the other hand,
	
	the iteration level parallelism on the {FPGA} is one to two orders
	
	of magnitude that on the CPUs. In addition to these two factors,
	
	we identify the efficiency advantage of {FPGA}s as an important factor
	
	and show that it ranges from 6 to 47 on our test benchmarks. We also
	
	identify some of the components of this factor: the streaming of
	
	data from memory, the overlap of control and data flow and the elimination
	
	of some instruction on the {FPGA}. The results provide a deeper understanding
	
	of the tradeoff between system complexity and performance when designing
	
	Configurable SoC as well as designing software for CSoC. They also

	of other entities. We call this phenomenon switching locality. The
	
	Interconnection Cached Network (ICN) is a reconfigurable network
	
	especially suited for exploiting switching locality. It consists
	
	of many small, fast crossbars interconnected by a large, slow switching
	
	crossbar. The large crossbar is used for topology reconfiguration
	
	and the smaller crossbars for circuit switching. For a large class
	
	of communication patterns displaying switching locality (this includes
	
	meshes, tori, trees, rings, pyramids, etc.), it is possible to choose
	
	appropriate ICN configurations and assignments of processes to processors
	
	such that all communication paths pass through two or less switching
	
	components. Much of the previous work on performance analysis of
	
	networks has assumed random, uniformly distributed communication
	
	and is inapplicable to many real-life parallel applications that
	
	lack this uniformity. We develop a methodology to analyze the performance
	
	of synchronous, circuit switched networks under different communication
	
	traffic patterns. We employ this methodology to study the performance
	
	of the ICN in comparison to more popular reconfigurable networks:
	
	the delta and the crossbar. We choose two different communication
	
	patterns -- a 2-D torus representing a high degree of switching locality
	
	and a fully connected graph representing complete absence of such
	
	locality. We show that in the presence of locality, the ICN comes
	
	very close to matching the crossbar's performance. This, together
	
	with the shorter network cycle period of the ICN, makes it more desirable.
	
	In the absence of switching locality, the reconfigurability of the
	
	ICN allows for a graceful degradation in performance.},

	Most previous work on tiling is limited in at least one of the following

	depth using polyhedral tiles. We derive a prediction formula for
	
	the execution time of such tiled loops, which can be used by a compiler
	
	to automatically determine the tiling parameters that minimizes the
	
	execution time. We also explain the notion of rise, a measure of
	
	the relationship between the shape of the tiles and the shape of
	
	the iteration space generated by the loop nest. The rise is a powerful
	
	tool in predicting the execution time of a tiled loop. It allows

	26.58 teraflop/s for an atmospheric general circulation code (AFES).

	The ES consists of 640 processor nodes (PN) and an interconnection

	multiprocessor (SMP) architecture since it was first introduced in
	
	1982. This paper introduces an alternative view of the relationship
	
	between scalable technologies and SMPs. Instead of replacing large
	
	SMPs with scalable technology, we propose new scalable techniques
	
	that allow large SMPs to be tied together efficiently, while maintaining
	
	the compatibility with, and performance characteristics of, an SMP.
	
	The trade-offs of such an architecture differ from those of traditional,
	
	scalable, Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (cc-NUMA) approaches.WildFire
	
	is a distributed shared-memory (DSM) prototype implementation based
	
	on large SMPs. It relies on two techniques for creating application-transparent
	
	locality: Coherent Memory Replication (CMR), which is a variation
	
	of Simple COMA/Reactive NUMA, and Hierarchical Affinity Scheduling
	
	(HAS). These two optimizations create extra node locality, which
	
	blurs the node boundaries to an application such that SMP-like performance
	
	can be achieved with no NUMA-specific optimizations.We present a
	
	performance study of a large OLTP benchmark running on DSMs built
	
	from various-sized nodes and with varying amounts of application-transparent
	
	locality. WildFire's measured performance is shown to be more than
	
	two times that of an unoptimized NUMA implementation built from small
	
	nodes and within 13\% of the performance of the ideal implementation:
	
	a large SMP with the same access time to its entire shared memory
	
	as the local memory access time of WildFire.},

	Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition
	
	diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively,
	
	with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These
	
	transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured

	and expressiveÃ¯Â¿Åsmall diagrams can express complex behaviorÃ¯Â¿Åas
	
	well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities
	
	of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description
	
	at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications
	
	manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate
	
	here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against
	
	conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification
	
	by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can
	
	be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part
	
	of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's
	
	other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification.
	
	We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the
	
	last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification
	
	of a particularly complex system.},

  abstract = {Parallel processing in computer systems is gaining importance: not
	
	only supercomputers, but today also desktop and laptop computers
	
	have multiple processors. To make all these processors work efficiently
	
	on a single problem, they have to communicate. To this end, processors
	
	are connected to each other, and to the outside world, through a
	
	communication network. This network should allow a fast exchange
	
	of information, such that the processors receive new data to process
	
	in a timely manner. Current technologies, using electrical signaling,
	
	are reaching the end of their capabilities, however. Moreover, the
	
	traffic on such networks is very irregular, making some parts of
	
	the network highly saturated while other parts are barely used. The
	
	precise patterns also depend on the application, and can even change
	
	during the run time of a single application. This makes it very difficult
	
	to build an efficient communication network. This doctoral dissertation
	
	explores the possibilities of optical, reconfigurable networks. Optical
	
	connections are one part of the solution to the communication problem,
	
	since they allow for much higher data rates. Moreover, optics allows
	
	the network to be reconfigured, during the course of a program, in
	
	a data-transparent way, to the current traffic patterns. This way,
	
	all network connections are utilized more efficiently, which can
	
	both increase the network`s performance and reduce power usage.},

	in the design of multicore processor architectures, just
	
	
	as in uniprocessor design. In contrast to single-threaded
	
	
	applications, however, many multi-threaded programs are
	
	
	not deterministic: in multiple runs, even on the same
	
	
	architecture, different execution paths can be taken. This
	
	
	results in variability of simulation results, which is a
	
	
	well-known phenomenon in real systems, but is nearly
	
	
	universally ignored in simulation experiments. In this
	
	
	paper, we review existing work on simulation variability.
	
	
	We extend this work, which has been focused mainly on
	
	
	commercial workloads, and show that it also applies to
	
	
	scientific workloads. We characterize variability for the
	
	
	SPLASH-2 benchmark applications, and look at how variability
	
	
	can impact the optimization of the interconnection
	
	
	network. Both previous and our own results show that
	
	
	studies aiming to prove the optimality of architectural
	
	
	or other modifications should keep this variability in
	
	
	mind, and make sure that observed improvements are
	
	
	statistically valid in relation to the inherent variability
	
	
	to avoid drawing the wrong conclusions. Although this
	
	
	problem is in no way solved to satisfaction, we review
	
	
	some possible solutions, such as the use of statistics, using
	
	
	different types of metrics, and sample-based simulation.},

  abstract = {Power estimation and optimization has become a key issue in embedded
	
	system design, especially in the rapidly growing market of mobile
	
	handbeld computing, communication, internet devices that are driven
	
	by battery power. It is of paramount importance to estimate and optimize
	
	power of those systems during an early design stage at a high level
	
	of abstraction in order to efficiently explore the design space and
	
	to take full advantage of the related high optimization potential.
	
	
	
	In this paper, we present Avalanche, a prototyping framework that
	
	addresses the issues of power estimation and optimization for mixed
	
	hardware and software embedded systems. Avalanche is based on a generic
	
	embedded system architecture consisting of embedded CPU, custom hardware,
	
	and a memory hierarchy. For system-level power estimation, given
	
	various system parameters like cache sizes, cache policies, and bus
	
	width, etc., Avalanche is able to rapidly evaluate/estimate power
	
	and performance and thus facilitate comprehensive design space explorations.
	
	For system-level power optimization, Avalanche offers different modes
	
	reflecting various design scenarios: if no hardware/software partitioning
	
	or only partial partitioning has been conducted, Avalanche guides
	
	the designer in finding power-aware hardware/software partitioning;
	
	when a system has already been partitioned, Avalanche can optimize
	
	system parameters such as cache and memory size; if system parameters
	
	and partitioning are given, Avalanche applies additional optimizations
	
	for power including source-to-source compiler transformations.
	
	
	Avalanche has been deployed during the design phase of real-world
	
	applications including an MPEG 11 encoder in a set-top box design.
	
	Extensive design space explorations in terms of power and performance
	
	could be conducted within several hours and various optimization
	
	techniques led to power reductions of up to 94 \% without performance
	
	losses and only a slight increases in total chip size (i.e., transistor
	
	count).},

  abstract = {The operation-centric hardware abstraction is useful for describing
	
	systems whose behavior exhibits a high degree of concurrency. In
	
	the operation-centric style, the behavior of a system is described
	
	as a collection of operations on a set of state elements. Each operation
	
	is specified as a predicate and a set of simultaneous state-element
	
	updates, which may only take effect in case the predicate is true
	
	on the current state values. The effect of an operation's state updates
	
	is atomic, that is, the legal behaviors of the system constitute
	
	some sequential interleaving of the operations. This atomic and sequential
	
	execution semantics permits each operation to be formulated as if
	
	the rest of the system were frozen and thus simplifies the description
	
	of concurrent systems. This paper presents an approach to synthesize
	
	an efficient synchronous digital implementation from an operation-centric
	
	hardware-design description. The resulting implementation carries
	
	out multiple operations per clock cycle and yet maintains the semantics
	
	that is consistent with the atomic and sequential execution of operations.
	
	The paper defines, and then gives algorithms to identify, conflict-free
	
	and sequentially composable operations that can be performed in the
	
	same clock cycle. The paper further gives an algorithm to generate
	
	the hardwired arbitration logic to coordinate the concurrent execution
	
	of conflict-free and sequentially composable operations. Lastly,
	
	the paper evaluates synthesis results based on the TRAC compiler
	
	for the TRSPEC operation-centric hardware-description language. The
	
	results from a pipelined processor example show that an operation-centric
	
	framework offers a significant reduction in design time, while achieving
	
	comparable implementation quality as traditional register-transfer-level
	
	design flows.},

	the die area occupied by the embedded internal buffer become the

	importance and is a fundamental building block for many systems,
	
	be they mechanical or electronic. However, this very important function
	
	is still highly inadequate in optical oscillators, particularly in
	
	semiconductor laser diodes. The limitations in tuning a laser frequency
	
	(or wavelength) include the tuning range and the speed of tuning,
	
	which is typically milliseconds or slower. In addition, the tuning
	
	is often not continuous and may require complex synchronization of
	
	several electrical control signals. In this Letter, we present a
	
	new tunable laser structure with a lightweight nanoelectromechanical
	
	mirror based on a single-layer, high-contrast subwavelength grating.
	
	The high-contrast subwavelength grating reflector enables a drastic
	
	reduction of the mirror mass, which increases the mechanical resonant
	
	frequency and hence tuning speed. This allows for a wavelength-tunable
	
	light source with potential switching speeds of the order of tens
	
	of nanoseconds and suggests various new areas of practical application,

  abstract = {With the continuing growth in the amount of genetic data, members
	
	of the bioinformatics community are developing a variety of data-mining
	
	applications to understand the data and discover meaningful information.
	
	These applications are important in defining the design and performance
	
	decisions of future high performance microprocessors. This paper
	
	presents a detailed data-sharing analysis and chip-multiprocessor
	
	(CMP) cache study of several multi-threaded data-mining bioinformatics
	
	workloads. For a CMP with a three-level cache hierarchy, we model
	
	the last-level of the cache hierarchy as either multiple private
	
	caches or a single cache shared amongst different cores of the CMP.
	
	Our experiments show that the bioinformatics workloads exhibit significant
	
	data-sharing -- 50-95\% of the data cache is shared by the different
	
	threads of the workload. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of
	
	data cache shared, for some workloads, as many as 98\% of the accesses
	
	to the last-level cache are to shared data cache lines. Additionally,
	
	the amount of data-sharing exhibited by the workloads is a function
	
	of the total cache size available -- the larger the data cache the
	
	better the sharing behavior. Thus, partitioning the available last-level
	
	cache silicon area into multiple private caches can cause applications
	
	to lose their inherent data-sharing behavior. For the workloads in
	
	this study, a shared 32MB last-level cache is able to capture a tremendous
	
	amount of data-sharing and outperform a 32MB private cache configuration
	
	by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, with shared last-level
	
	caches, the bandwidth demands beyond the last-level cache can be
	
	reduced by factors of 3-625 when compared to private last-level caches.},

  abstract = {The Streams-C compiler synthesizes hardware circuits for reconfigurable
	
	FPGA-based computers from parallel C programs. The Streams-C language
	
	consists of a small number of libraries and intrinsic functions added
	
	to a synthesizable subset of C, and supports a communicating process
	
	programming model. The processes may be either software or hardware
	
	processes, and the compiler manages communication among the processes
	
	transparently to the programmer. For the hardware processes, the
	
	compiler generates Register-Transfer-Level (RTL) VHDL, targeting
	
	multiple FPGAs with dedicated memories. For the software processes,
	
	a multi-threaded software program is generated.The Streams-C language
	
	and compiler offer a very high level of expressivity for reconfigurable
	
	computing application development, particularly for stream-processing
	
	applications. We find this is reflected in productivity, for a factor
	
	of up to 10 times improvement in time to produce a program. However,
	
	use of the tool in the ``real world'' is predicated on performance:
	
	only if such a compiler can deliver performance comparable to hand-coded
	
	performance will it be used in practice.This paper presents an application
	
	study of the Streams-C compiler. Four applications have been written
	
	in Streams-C and compiled to the AMC Wildforce board containing Xilinx
	
	4036's. Those same applications have been hand-coded in a combination
	
	of RTL and structural VHDL. We compare performance of the generated
	
	code with the hand-optimized code. Our study shows that the compiler-generated
	
	designs are 1.37--4 times the area and $1/2$--1 times the clock frequency
	
	of the hand designs. We find that the compiler, based on the SUIF
	
	infrastructure, can be greatly improved through various standard
	
	compiler optimizations that are not currently being exploited. Thus
	
	we are currently re-writing a public domain version of Streams-C
	
	to better optimize and target the Virtex chip.},

	unlimited hardware resources to a set of hardware tasks implementing
	
	arbitrary functions. By using partial reconfiguration, these tasks
	
	can be allocated and de-allocated on the reconfigurable architecture
	
	while others continue to operate. However, the exact placement of

	performance of a sequence of loop nests through a combination of
	
	loop and data layout transformations. Pure loop transformations are
	
	restricted by data dependencies and may not be very successful in
	
	optimizing imperfectly nested loops and explicitly parallelized programs.
	
	Although pure data transformations are not constrained by data dependencies,
	
	the impact of a data transformation on an array might be program-wide;
	
	that is, it can affect all the references to that array in all the
	
	loop nests. Therefore, in this paper we argue for an integrated approach
	
	that employs both loop and data transformations. The method enjoys
	
	the advantages of most of the previous techniques for enhancing locality
	
	and is efficient. In our approach, the loop nests in a program are
	
	processed one by one and the data layout constraints obtained from
	
	one nest are propagated for optimizing the remaining loop nests.
	
	We show a simple and effective matrix-based framework to implement
	
	this process. The search space that we consider for possible loop
	
	transformations can be represented by general nonsingular linear
	
	transformation matrices and the data layouts that we consider are

	in embedded systems are extremely important. Using a suitable combination
	
	of program transformations and memory design space exploration aimed
	
	at enhancing data locality enables significant reductions in effective

	on-chip memory partitioning step, and a code-rewriting phase that
	
	collectively transform an input code automatically to take advantage

	The standard technique for {Java} execution is interpretation, which
	
	provides for extensive portability of programs. A {Java} interpreter
	
	dynamically executes {Java} bytecodes, which comprise the instruction
	
	set of the {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM). Execution time performance
	
	of {Java} programs can be improved through compilation, possibly
	
	at the expense of portability. Various types of {Java} compilers
	
	have been proposed, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that compile
	
	bytecodes into native processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers
	
	that directly translate the {Java} source code into the target processorÂs
	
	native language; and bytecode-to-source translators that generate
	
	either native code or an intermediate language, such as C, from the
	
	bytecodes. Additional techniques, including bytecode optimization,
	
	dynamic compilation, and executing {Java} programs in parallel, attempt
	
	to improve {Java} run-time performance while maintaining {Java}Âs
	
	portability. Another alternative for executing {Java} programs is
	
	a {Java} processor that implements the JVM directly in hardware.
	
	In this survey, we discuss the basic features, and the advantages
	
	and disadvantages, of the various {Java} execution techniques. We
	
	also discuss the various {Java} benchmarks that are being used by
	
	the {Java} community for performance evaluation of the different
	
	techniques. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of the performance
	
	of the alternative {Java} execution techniques based on reported

	suitable for large-scale distributed shared memory (DSM) systems.
	
	The approach is based on an interconnect technology which combines
	
	optical components and a novel architecture design. In DSM systems,
	
	numerous shared memory transactions such as requests, responses and
	
	acknowledgment messages propagate simultaneously in the network.
	
	As the network size increases, network contention results in increasing
	
	the critical remote memory access latency, which significantly penalizes
	
	the performance of DSM systems. In our proposed architecture called
	
	reconfigurable and scalable all-photonic interconnect for distributed-shared
	
	memory (font color=990000>RAPID/b>), we provide high connectivity
	
	by maximizing the channel availability for remote communication to
	
	reduce the critical remote latency. RAPID provides fast and efficient
	
	unicast, multicast and broadcast capabilities using a combination
	
	of aggressively designed wavelength division multiplexing (WDM),
	
	time division multiplexing (TDM), and space division multiplexing
	
	(SDM) techniques. RAPID is wavelength-routed, permitting the same
	
	limited set of wavelength to be reused among all processors. We evaluated
	
	RAPID based on network characteristics, power budget criteria, and
	
	by simulation using synthetic traffic workloads and compared it against
	
	other networks such as electrical ring, torus, mesh, and hypercube
	
	networks. We found that RAPID outperforms all networks and still
	
	provides good performance as the network is scaled to very large

  abstract = {Scalable shared-memory multiprocessors are often slowed down by long-latency
	
	memory accesses. One way to cope with this problem is to use data
	
	forwarding to overlap memory accesses with computation. With data
	
	forwarding, when a processor produces a datum, in addition to updating
	
	its cache, it sends a copy of the datum to the caches of the processors
	
	that the compiler identified as consumers of it. As a result, when
	
	the consumer processors access the datum, they find it in their caches.
	
	This paper addresses two main issues. First, it presents a framework
	
	for a compiler algorithm for forwarding. Second, using address traces,
	
	it evaluates the performance impact of different levels of support
	
	for forwarding. Our simulations of a 32-processor machine show that
	
	an optimistic support for forwarding speeds up five applications
	
	by an average of 50\% for large caches and 30\% for small caches.
	
	For large caches, most sharing read misses are eliminated, while
	
	for small caches, forwarding does not increase the number of conflict
	
	misses significantly. Overall, support for forwarding in shared-memory
	
	multiprocessors promises to deliver good application speedups.},

  abstract = {With the diffusion of {Java} in advanced multimedia mobile devices,
	
	there is a growing need for speeding up the execution of {Java} Bytecode
	
	beyond the limits of traditional interpreters and just-in-time compilers.
	
	In this area, {Java} coprocessors are viewed as a promising technology,
	
	which marries the exibility of a general purpose microprocessor
	
	to run legacy code and lightweight {Java} methods, with the high
	
	performance of a specialized execution engine on speed-critical bytecode.
	
	This work proposes and analyzes a microprocessor with {FPGA} coprocessor
	
	architecture with efcient shared-memory communication support. Furthermore,
	
	we describe a complete run-time environment that supports dynamic
	
	migration of {Java} methods to the coprocessor, and we quantitatively
	
	analyze speedups achievable under a number of system congurations

  abstract = {To exploit parallelism on shared memory parallel computers (SMPCs),
	
	it is natural to focus on decomposing the computation (mainly by
	
	distributing the iterations of the nested Do-Loops). In contrast,
	
	on distributed memory parallel computers (DMPCs), the decomposition
	
	of computation and the distribution of data must both be handled---in
	
	order to balance the computation load and to minimize the migration
	
	of data. We propose and validate experimentally a method for handling
	
	computations and data synergistically to minimize the overall execution
	
	time on DMPCs. The method is based on a number of novel techniques,
	
	also presented in this article. The core idea is to rank the "importance"
	
	of data arrays in a program and specify some of the dominant. The
	
	intuition is that the dominant arrays are the ones whose migration
	
	would be the most expensive. Using the correspondence between iteration
	
	space mapping vectors and distributed dimensions of the dominant
	
	data array in each nested Do-loop, allows us to design algorithms
	
	for determining data and computation decompositions at the same time.
	
	Based on data distribution, computation decomposition for each nested
	
	Do-loop is determined based on either the "owner computes" rule or
	
	the "owner stores" rule with respect to the dominant data array.
	
	If all temporal dependence relations across iteration partitions
	
	are regular, we use tiling to allow pipelining and the overlapping
	
	of computation and communication. However, in order to use tiling
	
	on DMPCs, we needed to extend the existing techniques for determining
	
	tiling vectors and tile sizes, as they were originally suited for
	
	SMPCs only. The overall method is illustrated on programs for the
	
	2D heat equation, for the Gaussian elimination with pivoting, and
	
	for the 2D fast Fourier transform on a linear processor array and
	
	on a 2D processor grid.},

	and the speed of the shared buses limit the address/snoop bandwidth
	
	needed to broadcast transactions to all processors. As a solution,
	
	a scalable address subnetwork called symmetric multiprocessor network
	
	(SYMNET) is proposed in which address requests and snoop responses
	
	of SMPs are implemented optically. SYMNET not only uses passive optical
	
	interconnects that increases the speed of the proposed network, but
	
	also pipelines address requests at a much faster rate than electronics.
	
	This increases the address bandwidth for snooping, but the preservation
	
	of cache coherence can no longer be maintained with the usual snooping
	
	protocols. A modified coherence protocol, coherence in SYMNET (COSYM),
	
	is introduced to solve the coherence problem. COSYM was evaluated
	
	with a subset of Splash-2 benchmarks and compared with the electrical
	
	bus-based MOESI protocol. The simulation studies have shown a 5-66
	
	percent improvement in execution time for COSYM as compared to MOESI
	
	for various applications. Simulations have also shown that the average
	
	latency for a transaction to complete using COSYM protocol was 5-78
	
	percent better than the MOESI protocol. It is also seen that SYMNET
	
	can scale up to hundreds of processors while still using fast snooping-based
	
	cache coherence protocols, and additional performance gains may be
	
	attained with further improvement in optical device technology.},

  abstract = {The authors address the primary limitation of bandwidth demands for
	
	address transaction in future cache coherent symmetric multiprocessors
	
	(SMPs). As a solution, the authors propose a scalable address subnetwork
	
	called symmetric multiprocessor network (SYMNET) in which address
	
	requests and snoop responses of shared memory multiprocessors are
	
	implemented optically. As the address phase of the transaction is
	
	linked to the address bandwidth, which is the major bottleneck in
	
	SMPs, they focus only on the address subnetwork in this paper. SYMNET
	
	has the capability to pipeline address requests from successive processors,
	
	which results in increasing the available address bandwidth and lowering
	
	the latency of the network. An optical token is implemented to achieve
	
	mutual exclusion to the shared channel. This enables collisionless
	
	broadcast of multiple address requests. The simultaneous insertion
	
	of multiple address requests into the address subnetwork complicates
	
	cache coherence. A modified coherence protocol, called COSYM, was
	
	introduced to solve the coherence problem. The authors evaluated
	
	SYMNET with a subset of Splash-2 benchmarks running from 4-32 processors.
	
	Their simulation studies have shown 10\%-67\% improvement in execution
	
	time for various applications. It is also shown that the average
	
	latency for a transaction to complete using COSYM was 85\% better
	
	than the electrical case. An overview of the proposed optical implementation
	
	of SYMNET is presented along with the theoretical power budget and
	
	bit-error rate analysis. This analysis shows that SYMNET can scale
	
	up to hundreds of processors while still using fast snoopy-based
	
	cache coherence protocols and that additional performance gains may
	
	be attained with further improvement in optical device technology.},

	demands for address transactions in future cache-coherent symmetric
	
	multiprocessors (SMPs). It is widely known that the bus speed and
	
	the coherence overhead limit the snoop/address bandwidth needed to
	
	broadcast address transactions to all processors. As a solution,
	
	we propose a scalable address subnetwork called symmetric multiprocessor
	
	network (SYMNET) in which address requests and snoop responses of
	
	SMPs are implemented optically. SYMNET not only has the ability to
	
	pipeline address requests, but also multiple address requests from
	
	different processors can propagate through the address subnetwork
	
	simultaneously. This is in contrast with all electrical bus-based
	
	SMPs, where only a single request is broadcast on the physical address
	
	bus at any given point in time. The simultaneous propagation of multiple
	
	address requests in SYMNET increases the available address bandwidth
	
	and lowers the latency of the network, but the preservation of cache
	
	coherence can no longer be maintained with the usual fast snooping
	
	protocols. A modified snooping cache-coherence protocol, coherence
	
	in SYMNET (COSYM) is introduced to solve the coherence problem. We
	
	evaluated SYMNET with a subset of Splash-2 benchmarks and compared
	
	it with the electrical bus-based MOESI (modified, owned, exclusive,
	
	shared, invalid) protocol. Our simulation studies have shown a 5

	for various applications. Simulations have also shown that the average

	and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation
	
	system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable,
	
	transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools
	
	(called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin
	
	follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an
	
	application at the instruction level without the need for detailed
	
	knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed
	
	to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools
	
	source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool
	
	can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation
	
	with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe
	
	the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic
	
	compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For
	
	efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register
	
	re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize
	
	instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly
	
	better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example,
	
	Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for
	
	basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe
	
	two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is
	
	publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32
	
	(32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium, and ARM. In the ten months

	processor, that utilizes a field-programmable gate array ({FPGA})
	
	to improve the speed and energy consumption of a software binary
	
	executing on a microprocessor. Unlike previous approaches that also
	
	improve software using an {FPGA} but do so using a special compiler,
	
	a {{{{WARP}}}} processor achieves these improvements completely transparently
	
	and operates from a standard binary. A {{{{WARP}}}} processor dynamically
	
	detects the binary's critical regions, reimplements those regions
	
	as a custom hardware circuit in the {FPGA}, and replaces the software
	
	region by a call to the new hardware implementation of that region.
	
	While not all benchmarks can be improved using {{{{WARP}}}} processing,
	
	many can, and the improvements are dramatically better than those
	
	achievable by more traditional architecture improvements. The hardest
	
	part of {{{{WARP}}}} processing is that of dynamically reimplementing
	
	code regions on an {FPGA}, requiring partitioning, decompilation,
	
	synthesis, placement, and routing tools, all having to execute with
	
	minimal computation time and data memory so as to coexist on chip
	
	with the main processor. We describe the results of developing our

	designed to enable lean place and route tools, and we developed extremely
	
	fast and efficient versions of partitioning, decompilation, synthesis,
	
	technology mapping, placement, and routing. {{{WARP}}} processors
	
	achieve overall application speedups of 6.3X with energy savings
	
	of 66&percent; across a set of embedded benchmark applications. We
	
	further show that our tools utilize acceptably small amounts of computation
	
	and memory which are far less than traditional tools. Our work illustrates
	
	the feasibility and potential of {{{WARP}}} processing, and we can
	
	foresee the possibility of {{{WARP}}} processing becoming a feature

	rewriting, while at the same time ensuring efficient production code.

	and threading models, whether symmetric or asymmetric, has a heavy
	
	influence on how best to control task or thread execution. Debugging

	complex job, when compared to traditional single-processor debug,
	
	or the debug of simple MP systems that are only very loosely coupled.
	
	The interaction between the system, applications and software views,

	the problem space. Zeroing in on the optimal solution for a particular
	
	MPSoC design demands a multi-disciplinary approach. After reviewing

	tens of processor cycles in uniprocessors and over a hundred cycles
	
	in multiprocessors. These figures are likely to grow even larger
	
	over the next decade, and systems architects have responded by adding
	
	one or more levels of cache into memory hierarchies between the processo
	
	r and main memory. Even with these hierarchies, however, many programs
	
	still have poor memory performance if cache misses are common. To
	
	improve program memory performance, programmers and compiler writers

	better exploits the memory hierarchy. The challenge in achieving
	
	these program transformations is overcoming the difficulty of statically

	helps programmers comprehend data structure and code segment interactions
	
	by displaying statistics in terms of both the program s data and
	
	code structures, rather than for code structures alone. MemSpy uses
	
	cache simulations to gather detailed memory statistics.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, processor speed has become significantly faster
	
	than memory speed. Small, fast cache memories are designed to overcome
	
	this discrepancy, but they are only effective when programs exhibit
	
	data locality. In the this article, we present compiler optimizations
	
	to improve data locality based on a simple yet accurate cost model.
	
	The model computes both temporal and spatial reuse of cache lines
	
	to find desirable loop organizations. The cost model drives the application
	
	of compound transformations consisting of loop permutation, loop
	
	fusion, loop distribution, and loop reversal. To validate our optimization
	
	strategy, we implemented our algorithms and ran experiments on a
	
	large collection of scientific programs and kernels. Experiments
	
	illustrate that for kernels our model and algorithm can select and
	
	achieve the best loop structure for a nest. For over 30 complete
	
	applications, we executed the original and transformed versions and
	
	simulated cache hit rates. We collected statistics about the inherent
	
	characteristics of these programs and our ability to improve their
	
	data locality. To our knowledge, these studies are the first of such
	
	breadth and depth. We found performance improvements were difficult
	
	to achieve bacause benchmark programs typically have high hit rates
	
	even for small data caches; however, our optimizations significanty
	
	improved several programs.},

	domains represent sets of invariants of the form (vj - vi in C),
	
	where vj and vi are two variables, and C lives in an abstraction
	
	of P(Z), P(Q), or P(R). We will call this family of domains weakly
	
	relational domains. The underlying concept allowing this construction
	
	is an extension of potential graphs and shortest-path closure algorithms
	
	in exotic-like algebras. Example constructions are given in order
	
	to retrieve well-known domains as well as new ones. Such domains
	
	can then be used in the Abstract Interpretation framework in order
	
	to design various static analyses. Amajor benfit of this construction

	technology will permit more than one billion transistors on a chip
	
	by the year 2010. The MIT Raw microprocessor is a proposed architecture
	
	that strives to exploit these chip-level resources by implementing
	
	thousands of tiles, each comprising a processing element and a small
	
	amount of memory, coupled by a static two-dimensional interconnect.
	
	A compiler partitions fine-grain instruction-level parallelism across
	
	the tiles and statically schedules intertile communication over the
	
	interconnect. Because Raw microprocessors fully expose their internal
	
	hardware structure to the software, they can be viewed as a gigantic
	
	FPGA with coarse-grained tiles in which software orchestrates communication
	
	over static interconnections. One open challenge in Raw architectures
	
	is to determine their optimal grain size and balance. The grain size
	
	is the area of each tile and the balance is the proportion of area
	
	in each tile devoted to memory, processing, communication, and off-chip
	
	global I/O. If the total chip area is fixed, higher processing power
	
	per tile requires large tiles and hence reduces the total number
	
	of tiles on the chip. This paper presents SimpleFit, a novel analytical
	
	framework that designers can use to reason about the design space
	
	of Raw microprocessors. Our model is also generalizable to multiprocessors
	
	on a chip. Based on an architectural model, an application model,
	
	and a VLSI cost analysis, the framework computes the performance
	
	of applications and uses an optimization process to identify designs
	
	that will execute these applications most cost-effectively. Although
	
	the optimal machine configurations obtained vary for different applications,
	
	problem sizes, and budgets, the general trends for various applications
	
	are similar. Accordingly, for the applications studied, assuming
	
	a onr billion logic transistor equivalent area, we recommend building
	
	a Raw chip with approximately 1,000 tiles, 30 words/cycle global
	
	I/O, 20 Kbytes of local memory per tile, three to four words/cycle
	
	local communication bandwidth, and single-issue processors. This
	
	configuration will give performance near the global optimum for most

  title = {Scheduling Techniques for Synchronous and Multidimensional Synchronous
	
	Dataflow},
  school = {University of California at Berkeley},
  year = {1996},
  month = {December},
  note = {Professor Edward A. Lee, Chair},
  abstract = {In this thesis, we present various scheduling techniques for programs
	
	expressed as Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) and Multidimensional Synchronous
	
	dataflow graphs. Synchronous dataflow has proven efficient as a specification
	
	model for block-diagram based programming environments for signal
	
	processing. Two key reasons for its popularity are that a) static
	
	schedules can be constructed at compile time, thus eliminating the
	
	overhead due to dynamic scheduling, and b) it models multirate signal
	
	processing application very naturally and intuitively. The first
	
	property is particularly important in environments where code-synthesis
	
	for embedded processors is desirable, since embedded signal processing
	
	applications have rigid throughput requirements in order to meet
	
	hardreal- time constraints. Multidimensional Synchronous Dataflow
	
	(MDSDF) is an extension of SDF to multiple dimensions; in this model,
	
	applications such as image and video signal processing, which operate
	
	on multidimensional signal spaces, are more naturally modeled and
	
	specified than in SDF. The amount of on-chip memory available on
	
	embedded processors is often severely limited. Adding off-chip memory
	
	is usually not an option because it entails a speed penalty, it increases
	
	overall system cost and size, and increases power requirements. Thus,
	
	when generating software implementations from SDF specifications
	
	for a uniprocessor, the scheduling problem of minimizing code size
	
	and buffer memory size becomes crucial. If the scheduling is not
	
	done carefully, the blowup in the size of the implementation can
	
	preclude implementation on the processor. Previous techniques have
	
	focused on scheduling to minimize code size. However, this neglected
	
	the buffer memory usage of the schedule; in this thesis, we develop
	
	techniques that jointly minimize for code size and buffer-memory
	
	size of the software implementation. We give three polynomial-time
	
	algorithms: a dynamic programming algorithm that is used as a post-optimization
	
	step, and two heuristics that use different approaches to constructing
	
	these schedules. The general problem is shown to be NP-complete,
	
	thus justifying the use of heuristics. An extensive experimental
	
	study is given to show the efficacy of all these techniques. We extend
	
	these scheduling results to MDSDF specifications. We then tackle
	
	a problem of a different type. A multidimensional signal can be sampled
	
	in many different ways. A straightforward extension of one-dimensional
	
	sampling results in the so-called rectangular sampling structure,
	
	where the samples lie on a rectangular grid. However, a more general
	
	sampling structure is a geometrical lattice; sampling lattices that
	
	are not rectangular can have many advantages in certain applications.
	
	For example, a signal sampled on a non-rectangular lattice can have
	
	a lower sampling density than one sampled on an equivalent rectangular
	
	lattice. For real-time processing of multidimensional signals, a
	
	lower sampling density means fewer samples to process in a given
	
	time interval. The standard MDSDF model suffers from the inability
	
	to model multidimensional systems sampled on arbitrary sampling lattices;
	
	hence, we give an extension of MDSDF that is capable of modeling
	
	such systems. The model we give preserves the property of static,
	
	compile-time schedulability. However, constructing such schedules
	
	requires the solution to some challenging problems. In particular,
	
	we show that an augmented set of balance equations have to be solved
	
	simultaneously in the extended model. The additional equations are
	
	quite different from the usual balance equations in SDF and MDSDF;
	
	they involve computing so-called integer volumes of parallelepipeds.

  abstract = {Signal flow graphs with dataflow semantics have been used in signal
	
	processing system simulation, algorithm development, and real-time
	
	system design. Dataflow semantics implicitly expose function parallelism
	
	by imposing only a partial ordering constraint on the execution of
	
	functions. One particular form of dataflow called synchronous dataflow
	
	(SDF) has been quite popular in programming environments for digital
	
	signal processing (DSP) since it has strong formal properties and
	
	is ideally suited for expressing multirate DSP algorithms. However,
	
	SDF and other dataflow models use first-in first-out (FIFO) queues
	
	on the communication channels and are thus ideally suited only for
	
	one-dimensional (1-D) signal processing algorithms. While multidimensional
	
	systems can also be expressed by collapsing arrays into 1-D streams,
	
	such modeling is often awkward and can obscure potential data parallelism
	
	that might be present. SDF can be generalized to multiple dimensions;
	
	this model is called multidimensional synchronous dataflow (MDSDF).
	
	This paper presents MDSDF and shows how MDSDF can be efficiently
	
	used to model a variety of multidimensional DSP systems, as well
	
	as other types of systems that are not modeled elegantly in SDF.
	
	However, MDSDF generalizes the FIFO queues used in SDF to arrays
	
	and, thus, is capable only of expressing systems sampled on rectangular
	
	lattices. This paper also presents a generalization of MDSDF that
	
	is capable of handling arbitrary sampling lattices and lattice-changing
	
	operations such as nonrectangular decimation and interpolation. An
	
	example of a practical system is given to show the usefulness of
	
	this model. The key challenge in generalizing the MDSDF model is
	
	preserving static schedulability, which eliminates the overhead associated
	
	with dynamic scheduling, and preserving a model where data parallelism,
	
	as well as functional parallelism, is fully explicit},

  volume = {2},
  pages = {1-145},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Chip multiprocessors - also called multi-core microprocessors or CMPs
	
	for short - are now the only way to build high-performance microprocessors,
	
	for a variety of reasons. Large uniprocessors are no longer scaling
	
	in performance, because it is only possible to extract a limited
	
	amount of parallelism from a typical instruction stream using conventional
	
	superscalar instruction issue techniques. In addition, one cannot
	
	simply ratchet up the clock speed on today's processors, or the power
	
	dissipation will become prohibitive in all but water-cooled systems.
	
	Compounding these problems is the simple fact that with the immense
	
	numbers of transistors available on today's microprocessor chips,
	
	it is too costly to design and debug ever-larger processors every
	
	year or two. 
	
	
	CMPs avoid these problems by filling up a processor die with multiple,
	
	relatively simpler processor cores instead of just one huge core.
	
	The exact size of a CMPs cores can vary from very simple pipelines
	
	to moderately complex superscalar processors, but once a core has
	
	been selected the CMPs performance can easily scale across silicon
	
	process generations simply by stamping down more copies of the hard-to-design,
	
	high-speed processor core in each successive chip generation. In
	
	addition, parallel code execution, obtained by spreading multiple
	
	threads of execution across the various cores, can achieve significantly
	
	higher performance than would be possible using only a single core.
	
	While parallel threads are already common in many useful workloads,
	
	there are still important workloads that are hard to divide into
	
	parallel threads. The low inter-processor communication latency between
	
	the cores in a CMP helps make a much wider range of applications
	
	viable candidates for parallel execution than was possible with conventional,
	
	multi-chip multiprocessors; nevertheless, limited parallelism in
	
	key applications is the main factor limiting acceptance of CMPs in
	
	some types of systems. 
	
	
	After a discussion of the basic pros and cons of CMPs when they are
	
	compared with conventional uniprocessors, this book examines how
	
	CMPs can best be designed to handle two radically different kinds
	
	of workloads that are likely to be used with a CMP: highly parallel,
	
	throughput-sensitive applications at one end of the spectrum, and
	
	less parallel, latency-sensitive applications at the other. Throughput-sensitive
	
	applications, such as server workloads that handle many independent
	
	transactions at once, require careful balancing of all parts of a
	
	CMP that can limit throughput, such as the individual cores, on-chip
	
	cache memory, and off-chip memory interfaces. Several studies and
	
	example systems, such as the Sun Niagara, that examine the necessary
	
	tradeoffs are presented here. In contrast, latency-sensitive applications
	
	many desktop applications fall into this category require a focus
	
	on reducing inter-core communication latency and applying techniques
	
	to help programmers divide their programs into multiple threads as
	
	easily as possible. This book discusses many techniques that can
	
	be used in CMPs to simplify parallel programming, with an emphasis
	
	on research directions proposed at Stanford University. To illustrate
	
	the advantages possible with a CMP using a couple of solid examples,
	
	extra focus is given to thread-level speculation (TLS), a way to
	
	automatically break up nominally sequential applications into parallel
	
	threads on a CMP, and transactional memory. This model can greatly
	
	simplify manual parallel programming by using hardware instead of
	
	conventional software locks to enforce atomic code execution of blocks
	
	of instructions, a technique that makes parallel coding much less
	
	error-prone.},

	independence and portability, but because of its slow execution speed
	
	on a software {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM), some people decide to
	
	use faster languages such as C. Building a JVM in hardware is an
	
	obvious solution to this problem. Several approaches have been taken
	
	to try to achieve the best solution. One approach is by reducing
	
	the number of {Java} instructions a program has to execute along
	
	with directly executing instructions in hardware, for example on
	
	a Field Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA}), to increase the execution
	
	speed. Another approach is the translation of {Java} Byte Codes into
	
	native code by a {FPGA} and then executing the native code on a conventional
	
	CPU. Others have developed a multithreaded JVM and exploited the
	
	parallelism offered by a {FPGA} and have specifically designed the
	
	JVM for real-time systems. This paper compares and contrasts all
	
	these approaches and then argues that the parallelism of a {FPGA}
	
	should be exploited in the most general way possible by not restricting
	
	the threads of execution to a specific task. It gives a method for
	
	building such a JVM and also some results from a JVM that was built
	
	using this method. The paper concludes that this approach should
	
	be taken to build a system that is capable of running threads of
	
	a {Java} program in parallel.},

	under a closer relationship with the underlying platform. The current
	
	trend is towards an increasing embedded software development effort
	
	under more stringent time-to-market requirements. As a consequence,
	
	it is necessary to reduce software generation cost while maintaining
	
	reliability and design quality. In that context, languages centered
	
	on describing whole systems, with software and hardware parts, have
	
	been proposed. Among these, SystemC is gaining increasing interest
	
	as a specification language for embedded systems. SystemC supports
	
	the specification of the complete system and the modeling of the
	
	platform. In this paper, the application of SystemC to performance
	
	analysis and embedded software generation is discussed. A single-source

	specification and profiling, and, after architectural mapping, for
	
	HW/SW co-simulation and embedded software generation. A design environment
	
	based on C++ libraries for performance analysis and software generation
	
	is presented. This approach avoids working on intermediate formats
	
	and translators, which facilitates the designer?s interaction with
	
	the system description throughout the development process. Additionally,
	
	it ensures the preservation of the computational models used for
	
	the system specification during architectural mapping and compilation.},

	If all of the operations required to perform a given computation

	have implemented a prototype compilation system that uses commutativity
	
	analysis as its primary analysis technique. We have used this system

  abstract = {A modular synthesis flow is essential for a scalable and hierarchical
	
	design methodology. This paper considers a particular modular flow
	
	where each module has interface methods and the internal behavior
	
	of the module is described in terms of a set of guarded atomic actions
	
	on the state elements of the module. A module can also read and update
	
	the state of other modules but only by invoking the interface methods
	
	of those modules. This paper extends the past work on hardware synthesis
	
	of a set of guarded atomic actions by Hoe and Arvind to modules of
	
	such actions. It presents an algorithm that, given the scheduling
	
	constraints on the interface methods of the called modules, derives
	
	the "glue logic" and the scheduling constraints for the interface
	
	methods of the calling module such that the atomicity of the guarded
	
	actions is preserved across module boundaries. Such modules provide
	
	reusable IP which facilitates "correctness by construction" design
	
	methodology. It also reduces compile-times dramatically in comparison
	
	to the compilation that flattens all the modules first.},

	Dynamic Prefetching Thread on traditional Chip Multiprocessors. Aiming
	
	at the loosely coupled feature of Chip Multiprocessors, we present
	
	the ÂShadow RegisterÂ mechanism to support rapid register transportation
	
	among multi-cores and discuss the selection of thread spawn time.
	
	Furthermore, two aggressive thread construction policies, known as
	
	ÂSelf-LoopÂ and ÂFork-on-Recursive-CallÂ, are proposed. ÂSelf-LoopÂ
	
	policy can greatly enlarge the prefetching range and issue more timely
	
	prefetches. ÂFork-on-Recursive-CallÂ policy can eVectively accelerate
	
	applications accessing trees or graphs via recursive calls. For a

	CPU2000 as well as Stream benchmark, an average speedup of 3.8% is
	
	achieved on dual-core CMP when constructing basic Dynamic Prefetching

  abstract = {With the rise of Chip multiprocessors (CMPs), the amount of parallel
	
	computing power will increase significantly in the near future. However,
	
	most programs are sequential in nature and have not been explicitly
	
	parallelized, so they cannot exploit these parallel resources. Automatic
	
	parallelization of sequential, non-regular codes is very hard, as
	
	illustrated by the lack of solutions after more than 30 years of
	
	research on the topic. The question remains if there is parallelism
	
	in sequential programs that can be detected automatically and if
	
	so, how much parallelism there is. .
	
	
	In this paper, we propose a framework for extracting potential parallelism
	
	from programs. Applying this framework to sequential programs can
	
	teach us how much parallelism is present in a program, but also tells
	
	us what the most appropriate parallel construct for a program is,
	
	e.g. a pipeline, master/slave work distribution, etc. 
	
	
	Our framework is profile-based, implying that it is not safe. It builds
	
	two new graph representations of the profile-data: the interprocedural
	
	data flow graph and the data sharing graph. This graphs show the
	
	data-flow between functions and the data structures facilitating
	
	this data-flow, respectively. We apply our framework on the SPECcpu2000
	
	bzip2 benchmark, achieving a speedup of 3.74 of the compression part
	
	and a global speedup of 2.45 on a quad processor system.},

	GPU architecture %, such as the NVIDIA GeForce 8-series, provide
	
	easier programmability and increased generality while maintaining
	
	the tremendous memory bandwidth and computational power of traditional
	
	GPUs. This opportunity should redirect efforts in GPGPU research
	
	from ad hoc porting of applications to establishing principles and
	
	strategies that allow efficient mapping of computation to graphics
	
	hardware. In this work we discuss the GeForce 8800 GTX processor's
	
	organization, features, and generalized optimization strategies.
	
	Key to performance on this platform is using massive multithreading
	
	to utilize the large number of cores and hide global memory latency.
	
	To achieve this, developers face the challenge of striking the right
	
	balance between each thread's resource usage and the number of simultaneously
	
	active threads. The resources to manage include the number of registers
	
	and the amount of on-chip memory used per thread, number of threads
	
	per multiprocessor, and global memory bandwidth. We also obtain increased
	
	performance by reordering accesses to off-chip memory to combine
	
	requests to the same or contiguous memory locations and apply classical
	
	optimizations to reduce the number of executed operations. We apply
	
	these strategies across a variety of applications and domains and

	1.16X to 431X total application speedup.},

	of horizontal filtering along the rows followed by vertical filtering
	
	along the columns. It is well-known that a straightforward implementation
	
	of vertical filtering (assuming a row-major layout) induces many
	
	cache misses, due to lack of spatial locality. This can be avoided
	
	by interchanging the loops. This paper shows, however, that the resulting

	in the Pentium 4 when two data blocks are accessed that are a multiple
	
	of 64K apart, and we propose two techniques to avoid it. In addition,
	
	if the filter length is longer than four, the number of ways of the
	
	L1 data cache of the Pentium 4 is insufficient to avoid cache conflict
	
	misses. Consequently, we propose two methods for reducing conflict
	
	misses. Although experimental results have been collected on the
	
	Pentium 4, the techniques are general and can be applied to other

  abstract = {The current practice of mapping computations to custom hardware implementations
	
	requires programmers to assume the role of hardware designers. In
	
	tuning the performance of their hardware implementation, designers
	
	manually apply loop transformations such as loop unrolling. designers
	
	manually apply loop transformations. For example, loop unrolling
	
	is used to expose instruction-level parallelism at the expense of
	
	more hardware resources for concurrent operator evaluation. Because
	
	unrolling also increases the amount of data a computation requires,
	
	too much unrolling can lead to a memory bound implementation where
	
	resources are idle. To negotiate inherent hardware space-time trade-offs,
	
	designers must engage in an iterative refinement cycle, at each step
	
	manually applying transformations and evaluating their impact. This
	
	process is not only error-prone and tedious but also prohibitively
	
	expensive given the large search spaces and with long synthesis times.
	
	This paper describes an automated approach to hardware design space
	
	exploration, through a collaboration between parallelizing compiler
	
	technology and high-level synthesis tools. We present a compiler
	
	algorithm that automatically explores the large design spaces resulting
	
	from the application of several program transformations commonly
	
	used in application-specific hardware designs. Our approach uses
	
	synthesis estimation techniques to quantitatively evaluate alternate
	
	designs for a loop nest computation. We have implemented this design
	
	space exploration algorithm in the context of a compilation and synthesis
	
	system called DEFACTO, and present results of this implementation
	
	on five multimedia kernels. Our algorithm derives an implementation
	
	that closely matches the performance of the fastest design in the
	
	design space, and among implementations with comparable performance,
	
	selects the smallest design. We search on average only 0.3\% of the
	
	design space. This technology thus significantly raises the level
	
	of abstraction for hardware design and explores a design space much
	
	larger than is feasible for a human designer.},

	and unraveling network power/performancerelated issues. Extensive
	
	prior research in the area of classic networks such as the Internet,
	
	Ethernet, and wireless LANs transporting TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP traffic
	
	among others, has demonstrated how traffic models and model-based
	
	synthetic traffic generators can facilitate understanding of traffic
	
	characteristics and drive early-stage simulation to explore a large
	
	network design space. Though on-chip networks (a.k.a networks-on-chip
	
	(NoCs)) are becoming the de-facto scalable communication fabric in
	
	many-core systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and chip multiprocessors (CMPs),
	
	no on-chip network traffic model that captures both spatial and temporal
	
	variations of traffic has been demonstrated yet. As available on-chip
	
	resources increase with technology scaling, enabling a myriad of
	
	new network architectures, NoCs need to be designed from the application's
	
	perspective. In this paper we propose such an empirically-derived
	
	network on-chip traffic model for homogeneous NoCs. Our comprehensive
	
	model is based on three statistical parameters described with a 3-tuple,
	
	and captures the spatio-temporal characteristics of NoC traffic accurately
	
	with less than 5% error when compared to actual NoC application traces
	
	gathered from fullsystem simulations of three different chip platforms.
	
	We illustrate two potential uses of our traffic model: how it allows
	
	us to characterize and gain insights on NoC traffic patterns, and
	
	how it can be used to generate synthetic traffic traces that can
	
	drive NoC design-space exploration.},

	Metrics such as coverage and accuracy result from a simplistic classification

	the full effect of each prefetch and, hence, do not accurately reflect
	
	the quality of the prefetch algorithm. Gross statistics such as changes
	
	in the number of misses, total traffic, and IPC are not attributable
	
	to individual prefetches. Such gross metrics are therefore useful
	
	only for ranking existing prefetch algorithms; they do not evaluate
	
	the effect of individual prefetches so that an algorithm might be
	
	tuned. In this paper, we introduce a new, accurate, and complete

	the 3-D SPIHT bitstream more robust and resistant to channel errors.
	
	We first break the wavelet transform into a number of spatio-temporal
	
	tree blocks which can be encoded and decoded independently by the
	
	3-D SPIHT algorithm. This procedure brings the added benefit of parallelization
	
	of the compression and decompression algorithms, and enables implementation
	
	of region-based coding. We demonstrate the packetization of the bitstream
	
	and the reorganization of these packets to achieve scalability in
	
	bit rate and/or resolution in addition to robustness. Then we encode
	
	each packet with a channel code. Not only does this protect the integrity
	
	of the packets in most cases, but it also allows detection of packet-decoding
	
	failures, so that only the cleanly recovered packets are reconstructed.
	
	In extensive comparative tests, the reconstructed video is shown
	
	to be superior to that of MPEG-2, with the margin of superiority
	
	growing substantially as the channel becomes noisier. Furthermore,
	
	the parallelization makes possible real-time implementation in hardware
	
	and software},

  abstract = {Your free lunch will soon be over. What can you do about it? What
	
	are you doing about it. The major processor manufacturers and architectures,
	
	from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with
	
	most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance.
	
	Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput
	
	ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading
	
	and multicore architectures. Both of these features are available
	
	on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current
	
	PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel
	
	and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 InStat/MDR Fall Processor
	
	Forum (http://www.mdronline.com/ fpf04/index.html) was multicore
	
	devices, with many companies showing new or updated multicore processors.
	
	Looking back, it's not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of
	
	multicore. And that puts us at a fundamental turning point in software
	
	development, at least for the next few years and for applications
	
	targeting general-purpose desktop computers and low-end servers (which
	
	happens to account for the vast bulk of the dollar value of software
	
	sold today). In this article, I describe the changing face of hardware,
	
	why it suddenly does matter to software, and how it specifically
	
	matters to you and changes the way you'll likely be writing software
	
	in the future. Arguably, the free lunch has already been over for
	
	a year or two, only we're just now noticing.},

	and performance evaluation for mesh topology NoCs, and proposes general

	traffic generation: packet spatial distribution, packet injection
	
	rate and packet size. Two types of methods to evaluate performance
	
	in NoCs are discussed: (i) external evaluation, a common strategy

	conducted in an 8x8 mesh network, varying the routing algorithms
	
	and the number of virtual channels. The main contribution of this

	real-time window-based image processing is presented. The architecture
	
	was specially designed to implement efficiently, both in performance
	
	and hardware resource utilization, window-based image operators under
	
	real-time constraints. The computational core of the architecture
	
	is a configurable 2D systolic array of processing elements, which
	
	can provide throughputs over tenths of Giga Operations per Second
	
	(GOPs). The architecture employs a novel-addressing scheme that significantly
	
	reduces the memory access overhead and makes explicit the data parallelism
	
	at a low temporal storage cost. A specialized processing element,
	
	called Configurable Window Processor (CWP), was designed to cover
	
	a broad range of window-based image algorithms. The functionality
	
	of the CWPs can be modified through configuration registers according
	
	to a given application. For a current Field Programmable Gate Array
	
	({FPGA}) prototype of a 7x7 systolic array, the architecture provides
	
	a throughput of 3.16 GOPs at a 60 MHz clock frequency. The processing
	
	time for a 7x7 generic window-based image operator on 512x512 gray-level
	
	images is 8.35 ms. The implemented window-based image operators include
	
	generic image convolution, gray-level image morphology and template

	to define the behavior required of the hardware. Flamel undertakes
	
	to find parallelism in the program, so it can produce a fast-running
	
	implementation that meets a user-specified cost bound. A number of
	
	program transformations create sections of code with more parallel
	
	computations than the original program has. A novel feature of Flamel
	
	is a method for organizing the search for the transformations that
	
	best satisfy the goal. Another new algorithm is one for "expression
	
	height reduction": rewriting an ensemble of expressions using algebraic
	
	properties in order to compute the expressions faster. An implementation
	
	of Flamel has been completed. The output is a description of a datapath
	
	and a controller, and at a sufficient level of detail so that good
	
	area and execution time figures can be estimated. On a series of
	
	tests, Flamel produces implementations of programs that would run
	
	22 to 200 times faster than an MC68000 running the same programs,
	
	if the clock cycles were the same. The tests also show that a wide

	compatible with efficient current injection. Specific attention was
	
	paid to a tunnel-junction based approach. Bending loss was quantified

	methodology. The programming paradigm, in contrast with the conventional

	a given instruction set architecture, a onetime instruction set extension
	
	of eight instructions, is sufficient to implement the reconfigurable
	
	functionality of the processor. We propose a microarchitecture based
	
	on reconfigurable hardware emulation to allow high-speed reconfiguration

	optimization and forms the basis on which we build the two parts
	
	of this dissertation, a methodology for incremental loop transformations
	
	and an efficient enumeration technique for parametric integer sets.
	
	Power consumption for typical embedded multi-media applications is
	
	dominated by the storage of and the access to the large multi-dimensional
	
	arrays they manipulate. It is now well known that a design methodology
	
	for reducing power consumption and improving system performance should
	
	apply global loop transformations for increasing locality and regularity
	
	of data accesses. In the first part of this dissertation, we propose
	
	a two-step global loop transformation approach consisting of a linear
	
	transformation focusing mainly on regularity, and a translation focusing
	
	on locality. We further develop a refined regularity criterion and
	
	show how to perform the translation step incrementally, allowing
	
	multiple complicated cost functions to be evaluated. Many compiler
	
	optimization techniques depend on the enumeration of parametric integer
	
	sets defined by linear equations. In the second part of this dissertation,
	
	we present the first implementation of Barvinok's algorithm applied
	
	to the enumeration of parametric polytopes, extending an earlier
	
	implementation of this algorithm for a subclass of the enumeration
	
	problems we consider, and providing a significant improvement over
	
	another implementation based on a different technique. The resulting
	
	enumerator may be obtained as an explicit function or as a generating
	
	function. We further show that these two representations are polynomially
	
	interconvertible and we discuss some approaches for handling generalized
	
	enumeration problems.},

	These machines are attractive as compute servers because they provide

	latency to remote memory is 3 to 5 times the latency to local memory.
	
	CC-NOW machines provide the benefits of cache coherence to networks
	
	of workstations, at the cost of even higher remote access latency.
	
	Given the large remote access latencies of these architectures, data
	
	locality is potentially the most important performance issue. Using
	
	realistic workloads, we study the performance improvements provided
	
	by OS supported dynamic page migration and replication. Analyzing

	of the costs. We show that sampling of cache misses can be used to
	
	reduce cost without compromising performance, and that TLB misses
	
	may not be a consistent approximation for cache misses. Finally,
	
	our experiments show that dynamic page migration and replication
	
	can substantially increase application performance, as much as 30\%,

  abstract = {Virtual machines (VMs) such as the {Java} VM are a popular format
	
	for running architecture-neutral code in a managed runtime. Such
	
	VMs are typically implemented using a combination of interpretation
	
	and just-in-time compilation (JIT). A significant challenge for the
	
	portability of VM code is the growing popularity of multi-core architectures
	
	with specialized processing cores aimed at computation-intensive
	
	applications such as media processing. Such cores differ greatly
	
	in architectural design compared to traditional desktop processors.
	
	One such processing core is the Cell Broadband EngineÂs (Cell BE)
	
	Synergistic Processing Element (SPE). An SPE is a light weight VLIW
	
	processor core with a SIMD vector instruction set. In this paper
	
	we investigate some popular interpreter optimizations and introduce
	
	new optimizations exploiting the special hardware properties offered
	
	by the Cell BEÂs SPE.},

	1 Introduction
	
	
	(# Loop trafos [1], [4], [26])
	
	
	Challenging problems require compound trafos
	
	
	
	Previously used techniques:
	
	
	- Decide order of trafos a priori --> inadequate: desirability of
	
	trafo cannot be evaluated locally, one step at a time
	
	
	- Generate and test: Explore all different possible combinatinos of
	
	trafos
	
	
	- Some combinations of trafos may lead to same behavior
	
	
	- Some trafos come in infinite variations...
	
	
	
	Alternative:
	
	
	(# Loop interchange, reversal, skewing modelled as linear trafos [7],
	
	[8], [12], [13], [19], [21])
	
	
	Polyhedral loop has n - 1 degrees of parallelism [13]###, data locality
	
	in all loop dimensions [24]
	
	
	--> not usable for general loop nests with sequential loops --> commonly
	
	used: direction vectors [2], [26]
	
	
	--> solved here --> easy determination of legality of compound trafo
	
	
	
	Algos to improve parallelism and data locality.
	
	
	Even for simple systems compound trafos for data locality may be necessary
	
	[9, 10, 17].
	
	
	Optimal (compound) trafo without exhaustive search.
	
	
	Implemented in SUIF.
	
	
	
	2 Loop Transformations on Distance Vectors
	
	
	(# Survey of use of DisV-Loop trafos: [20])
	
	
	
	2.A Loop Nest Representation 
	
	
	(# Techniques for extracting DisVs from loops: [12, 16, 22])
	
	
	
	2.B Unimodular transformations
	
	
	Three elementary trafos:
	
	
	- Permutation
	
	
	- Reversal
	
	
	- Skewing --> Lower triangular UM matrix
	
	
	
	UM := { M | ^* M /in Z^(nxn) 
	
	
	^* |M| /in {-1, 1} } 
	
	
	= { Unimodular Matrices }
	
	
	ForAll (a, b): UM^(2) . a * b /in UM
	
	
	ForAll a: UM . a^(-1) /in UM
	
	
	
	Compound trafo matrix: Product of constructing matrices
	
	
	
	2.C Legality of Unimodalr Transformations
	
	
	
	Trafo = legal == Loop nest can be sequentially executed in lexicographical
	
	order
	
	
	
	T2.1: D = { dist vects } --> trafo T = legal == ForAll d : D . Td
	
	>lex 0
	
	
	
	Fully permutable loops: Any permutation allowed
	
	
	
	3 Parallelizing Loops with Distance Vectors
	
	
	n-deep DisV-loops have (n - 1) degrees of parallelism [13]
	
	
	
	3.A Canonical Form: A Fully Permutable Loop Nest
	
	
	DisV-loops always transformable to fully permutable loop nest via
	
	skewing (T3.1)
	
	
	
	3.B Parallelization
	
	
	3.B.1 Finest Granularity of Parallelism 
	
	
	Wavefront trafo
	
	
	- Skew innermost loop with all other loops
	
	
	- Interchange all loops in a cyclic way, making the innermost loop
	
	the outermost loop
	
	
	--> DOALL loops as innermost loops
	
	
	
	3.B.2 Coarsest Granularity of Parallelism
	
	
	Outermost parallel loops possible if DVs do not span iteration space
	
	(in full dimensionality) [14]

  abstract = {Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been heavily studied and developed
	
	in various scientific and engineering fields. Its multiresolution
	
	and locality nature facilitates applications requiring progressiveness
	
	and capturing high-frequency details. However, when dealing with
	
	enormous data volume, its performance may drastically reduce. On
	
	the other hand, with the recent advances in consumer-level graphics
	
	hardware, personal computers nowadays usually equip with a graphics
	
	processing unit (GPU) based graphics accelerator which offers SIMD-based
	
	parallel processing power. This paper presents a SIMD algorithm that
	
	performs the convolution-based DWT completely on a GPU, which brings
	
	us significant performance gain on a normal PC without extra cost.
	
	Although the forward and inverse wavelet transforms are mathematically
	
	different, the proposed algorithm unifies them to an almost identical
	
	process that can be efficiently implemented on GPU. Different wavelet
	
	kernels and boundary extension schemes can be easily incorporated
	
	by simply modifying input parameters. To demonstrate its applicability
	
	and performance, we apply it to wavelet-based geometric design, stylized
	
	image processing, texture-illuminance decoupling, and JPEG2000 image
	
	encoding},

	We present the sampling microarchitecture simulation (SMARTS) framework
	
	as an approach to enable fast and accurate performance measurements
	
	of full-length benchmarks. SMARTS accelerates simulation by selectively
	
	measuring in detail only an appropriate benchmark subset. SMARTS
	
	prescribes a statistically sound procedure for configuring a systematic
	
	sampling simulation run to achieve a desired quantifiable confidence
	
	in estimates. Analysis of 41 of the 45 possible SPEC2K benchmark/
	
	input combinations show CPI and energy per instruction (EPI) can
	
	be estimated to within 3\% with 99.7\% confidence by measuring fewer
	
	than 50 million instructions per benchmark. In practice, inaccuracy
	
	in micro-architectural state initialization introduces an additional
	
	uncertainty which we empirically bound to /spl sim/2\% for the tested
	
	benchmarks. Our implementation of SMARTS achieves an actual average
	
	error of only 0.64\% on CPI and 0.59\% on EPI for the tested benchmarks,
	
	running with average speedups of 35 and 60 over detailed simulation

	The automatically generated VHDL is compared to a manually crafted
	
	design. The generated design, as well as the manual one, are synthesized
	
	in Xilinx ISE 6.3i and the reported results are obtained from the
	
	actual execution on the {MOLEN} poly-
	
	
	morphic processor. Even though the automatically generated VHDL does
	
	not contain any optimizations, speedup
	
	
	of 7 is observed. However, compared to manually tuned VHDL, there
	
	is still a difference of several orders of magni-
	
	
	tude. This paper will explore the differences that explain the performance
	
	gap and identify sources of improvement
	
	
	and necessary optimizations that have to be implemented. Some of the

	known part of a system, called the context, conforms to a given overall
	
	specification. This question arises in several applications ranging
	
	from logic synthesis to the design of discrete controllers. We cast
	
	the problem as solving abstract equations over languages and study
	
	the most general solutions under the synchronous and parallel composition
	
	operators. We also specialize such language equations to languages
	
	associated with important classes of automata used for modeling systems,
	
	e.g., regular languages as counterparts of finite automata, FSM languages
	
	as counterparts of FSMs. Thus we can operate algorithmically on those
	
	languages through their automata and study how to solve effectively
	
	their language equations. We investigate the maximal subsets of solutions
	
	closed with respect to various language properties. In particular,
	
	we investigate classes of the largest compositional solutions (defined
	
	by properties exhibited by the composition of the solution and of
	
	the context). We provide the first algorithm to compute the largest
	
	compositionally progressive solution of synchronous equations. This
	
	approach unifies in a seamless frame previously reported techniques.
	
	As an application we solve the classical problem of synthesizing
	
	a converter between a mismatched pair of protocols, using their specifications,
	
	as well as those of the channel and of the required service.},

	of SELMOS for board-level reconfigurable optical interconnects is
	
	studied by the beam propagation method/finite difference time domain
	
	simulation focusing on three key issues; reducing size/cost of electrical
	
	to optical (E-O) and optical to electrical (O-E) signal conversion
	
	devices, tolerating alignment accuracy for optical coupling, and
	
	miniaturizing high-speed massive optical switching. S-FOLM, which
	
	consists of film-waveguide-based 3-D structures with embedded optoelectronic
	
	active elements and optical Z-connections for interplane links, enables
	
	drastic size/cost reduction of E-O and O-E conversion devices. 3D-MOSS,
	
	which is an S-FOLM with embedded microoptical switches, has a potentiality
	
	of 1024 /spl times/ 1024 switching with a system size of /spl sim/1.4
	
	/spl times/ 0.6 cm/sup 2/ and an insertion loss of 29 dB. The switching

	be /spl sim/2 /spl times/ 10/sup 5/ 1/s when PLZT waveguide-prism-deflector
	
	microoptical switches are used. By using advanced electrooptic materials,
	
	rates higher than 10/sup 8/ 1/s are expected. Twenty-five percent
	
	misalignment in waveguide assembly raises the insertion loss of the
	
	3D-MOSS to 73 dB. The loss is reduced to 32 dB in SELMOS-based 3D-MOSS,
	
	where a self-organized 3-D microoptical network is implemented using
	
	SOLNET. Further loss reduction is expected by structural optimization
	
	of loss-inducing parts. Thus, SELMOS is found to be a solution of
	
	the three key issues for board-level reconfigurable optical interconnects.
	
	In addition, photolithographic packaging with selectively occupied
	
	repeated transfer (PL-Pack with SORT), which integrates different
	
	types of active elements into one substrate in desired arrangements
	
	using an all-photolithographic process, can contribute to cost and

	not require any modification to processor, cache, or bus designs
	
	since all the functionality resides at the memory controller. As

	is enabled thanks to the introduction of an application adaptive

	materialized through a global hardware reconfiguration and local
	
	hardware reconfiguration by using partial and dynamic reconfiguration
	
	of FPGAs. A case study of a discret wavelet transform is used to
	
	demonstrate the feasibility in task adaptive level considering different
	
	types of filters. A platform based on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA is used
	
	for experimental implementation.},

  abstract = {Recent impressive performance improvements in computer architecture
	
	have not led to significant gains in the case of debugging. Software
	
	debugging often relies on inserting run-time software checks. In
	
	many cases, however, it is hard to find the root cause of a bug.
	
	Moreover, program execution typically slows down significantly, often
	
	by 10Â100 times. To address this problem, this paper introduces the
	
	intelligent watcher (iWatcher), a novel architectural scheme to monitor
	
	dynamic execution automatically, flexibly, and with minimal overhead.
	
	iWatcher associates program-specified monitoring functions with memory
	
	locations. When any such location is accessed, the monitoring function
	
	is automatically triggered with low overhead. To further reduce overhead
	
	and support rollback, iWatcher can optionally leverage thread-level
	
	peculation (TLS). The iWatcher architecture can be used to detect
	
	various bugs, including buffer overflow, accessing freed locations,
	
	memory leaks, stack-smashing and value-invariant violations. To evaluate
	
	iWatcher, we use seven applications with various real and injected
	
	bugs. Our results show that iWatcher detects many more software bugs
	
	than Valgrind, a well-known open-source bug detector. Moreover, iWatcher
	
	only induces a 0.1Â179% execution overhead, which is orders of magnitude
	
	less than Valgrind. Our sensitivity study shows that even with 20%
	
	of the dynamic loads monitored in a program, iWatcher adds only 72Â182%
	
	overhead. Finally, TLS is effective at reducing overheads for programs
	
	with substantial monitoring.},
