  abstract = {A protocol defines how systems communicate. There are two ways of
	
	specifying the protocol, the language of communication. One way is
	
	to specify the automaton that recognizes the language, and this is
	
	the approach taken by SDL, etc. The other more abstract way ss to
	
	specify the grammar of the language and let a tool synthesize the
	
	automaton. Directly specifying the automaton makes the specification
	
	implementation dependent in two ways: the time behavior is specified
	
	in terms of states, and the width of the inputs and outputs is fixed.
	
	By specifying the grammar, the specification is potentially independent
	
	of both these implementation details and allows design space exploration
	
	in these dimensions. This paper presents a grammar-based language,
	
	called Program, that supports a port-size independent specifications
	
	methodology and its application to parts of the Operation and Maintenance
	
	protocol, a typical application from the ATM world. The methodology
	
	has also been applied to another test set of example designs and
	
	compared to standard RTL synthesis and HLS in order to evaluate the

	structure of large design spaces. We have developed a general methodology
	
	for decomposing system design spaces into smaller component design
	
	spaces, followed by component-level evaluation, filtering, recomposition
	
	and system-level evaluation. This methodology greatly reduces the
	
	time and cost of design space exploration, since the typical number
	
	of system-level evaluations is greatly reduced. This paper describes
	
	the application of our decomposition methodology in the context of
	
	PICO. PICO is a design space exploration system that automatically
	
	generates embedded designs consisting of a stylized processor, hardware
	
	accelerator and a cache hierarchy, each customized to a benchmark.
	
	
	First, PICO splits the specified system design space into smaller
	
	design spaces, one for each of the components, viz. processor, accelerator
	
	and data/instruction/unified caches. PICO further partitions each
	
	component design space into predicated design spaces, so that all
	
	designs in a predicated design space satisfy a specified predicate.
	
	PICO uses component-level evaluations to identify the performance-cost
	
	optimal component-level Pareto designs in each predicated design
	
	space. PICO generates all compositions of Pareto designs from compatible
	
	predicated design spaces and uses a system-level evaluation to identify
	
	the Pareto designs at the system level. For reasonable design spaces,
	
	PICO reduces the design exploration time by over four orders of magnitude
	
	compared to an exhaustive approach.},

  abstract = {Automated design tools help to capture the benefits of customization
	
	in embedded system design while not exceeding design budgets. Such
	
	design tools must understand and exploit the hierarchical structure
	
	of design spaces, because systems of any significant complexity typically
	
	consist of components (subsystems). In order to reduce the design
	
	cost for such systems, designers develop the best component designs
	
	and restrict the number of system designs that they evaluate to those
	
	formed by combining these component designs.
	
	
	This report formalizes this overall approach. A decomposition splits
	
	a system design space into smaller design spaces, one for each of
	
	the components. The validity function determines whether a particular
	
	composition of component designs is a valid system design. We develop
	
	efficient ways to filter component designs from further consideration
	
	with minimal or no effect on the quality of system designs. First,
	
	we use a component-level validity filter to exclude component designs
	
	that are not part of any system design. Second, we split each of
	
	the remaining component designs into smaller predicated spaces, such
	
	that designs from only certain combinations of these spaces generate
	
	all valid designs. Finally, we employ component-level evaluation
	
	functions to generate high quality component designs. We show how
	
	these results were applied in the automated design of an embedded
	
	system consisting of a processor, hardware accelerator and cache
	
	memory hierarchy.},

  abstract = {We propose techniques for identifying and exploiting spatial and temporal
	
	reuse for indirectly indexed arrays. Indirectly indexed arrays are
	
	those arrays which are, typically, accessed inside multilevel loop
	
	nests and whose index expression includes not only loop iterators
	
	and constants but arrays as well. Existing techniques for improving
	
	locality are quite sophisticated in the case of directly indexed
	
	arrays. But, unfortunately, they are inadequate for handling indirectly
	
	indexed arrays. In this article we therefore extend the existing
	
	framework and techniques of directly indexed to indirectly indexed
	
	arrays. The concepts of reuse subspace, dependence vector, self,
	
	and group reuse are extended and applied in this new context. Also,
	
	lately scratch-pad memory has become an attractive alternative to
	
	data-cache, specially in the embedded multimedia community. This
	
	is because embedded systems are very sensitive to area and energy
	
	and the scratch-pad is smaller in area and consumes less energy on
	
	a per access basis compared to the cache of the same capacity. Several
	
	techniques have been proposed in the past for the efficient exploitation
	
	of the scratch-pad for directly indexed arrays. We extend these techniques
	
	by presenting a method for scratch-pad mapping of indirectly indexed
	
	arrays. This enables the scratch-pad to be used in a larger context
	
	than was possible before.},

	evaluate the performance of uniprocessor and multiprocessor system
	
	designs. This paper identifies performance variability as a potentially
	
	major challenge for architectural simulation studies using these
	
	workloads. Variability refers to the differences between multiple
	
	estimates of a workload's performance. Time variability occurs when
	
	a workload exhibits different characteristics during different phases
	
	of a single run. Space variability occurs when small variations in
	
	timing cause runs starting from the same initial condition to follow
	
	widely different execution paths. Variability is a well-known phenomenon
	
	in real systems, but is nearly universally ignored in simulation
	
	experiments. In a central result of this paper we show that variability
	
	in multi-threaded commercial workloads can lead to incorrect architectural
	
	conclusions (e.g., 31\% of the time in one experiment). We propose
	
	a methodology, based on multiple simulations and standard statistical

	wavelet transform (ODWT) subbands from the critically sampled DWT
	
	subbands (complete representation). This complete-to-overcomplete
	
	DWT (CODWT) has certain advantages in comparison to the conventional
	
	approach that performs the inverse DWT to reconstruct the input signal,
	
	followed by the a/spl grave/-trous or the lowband shift algorithm.
	
	Specifically, the computation of the input signal is not required.
	
	As a result, the minimum number of downsampling operations is performed
	
	and the use of upsampling is avoided. The proposed CODWT computes
	
	the ODWT subbands by using a set of prediction-filter matrices and
	
	filtering-and-downsampling operators applied to the DWT. This formulation
	
	demonstrates a clear separation between the single-rate and multirate
	
	components of the transform. This can be especially significant when
	
	the CODWT is used in resource-constrained environments, such as resolution-scalable
	
	image and video codecs. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed
	
	transform in these emerging applications, a new scheme for the transform-calculation
	
	is proposed, and existing coding techniques that benefit from its
	
	usage are surveyed. The analysis of the proposed CODWT in terms of
	
	arithmetic complexity and delay reveals significant gains as compared

  institution = {Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the
	
	history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore
	
	designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary
	
	compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to
	
	double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation.
	
	
	
	A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years
	
	to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach
	
	to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor
	
	systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor
	
	systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level
	
	parallelism.
	
	
	
	We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism
	
	at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing
	
	and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel
	
	landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following:
	
	
	
	-- The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs
	
	that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems.
	
	
	
	-- The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are
	
	built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS
	
	(Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon,
	
	and MIPS per development dollar.
	
	
	
	-- Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and
	
	evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf
	
	is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and
	
	communication.)
	
	
	
	-- "Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers
	
	in translating parallel programs.
	
	
	
	-- To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models
	
	must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware
	
	or applications.
	
	
	
	-- To be successful, programming models should be independent of the
	
	number of processors.
	
	
	
	-- To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support
	
	a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism:
	
	task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism.
	
	
	
	-- Architects should not include features that significantly affect
	
	performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their
	
	impact via performance counters and energy counters.
	
	
	
	-- Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating
	
	system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual
	
	machines.
	
	
	
	-- To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based
	
	on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable
	
	and low cost.
	
	
	
	Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware
	
	is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system
	
	software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel.
	
	Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones
	
	of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of
	
	highly parallel systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Disydent, a framework dedicated to system-on-a-chip
	
	(SoC) platform-based design for shared memory multiple instructions
	
	multiple data (MIMD) architectures. We define a platform-based design
	
	problem as a triplet (system, application, constraints) where the
	
	system is both an operating system (OS) and a hardware (HW) template
	
	that can be enhanced with dedicated coprocessors. Our contributions
	
	are: 1) the definition of a complete flow for platform-based design,
	
	from application to integration including all necessary intermediate
	
	steps and 2) a set of tightly bound operational tools to implement
	
	the flow. Disydent is based on four tools. The distributed process
	
	network (DPN) is a C library for describing Kahn process network
	
	(KPN)-based applications. The asynchronous serial interface mode
	
	register 0 (ASIM0) is a multiprocessor target platform running a
	
	microkernel. This platform can be enhanced with coprocessors generated
	
	by the user-guided high-level synthesis (UGH) tool. Cycle accurate
	
	system simulator (CASS) is a high-performance cycle-accurate simulator.
	
	The main steps of the design flow are KPN modeling, functional validation,
	
	design space exploration, high-level synthesis, and temporal validation.
	
	The design flow starts by modeling the application as a KPN. This
	
	initial description is done in C using the DPN library. The functional
	
	validation is performed by running the initial description directly
	
	on the host. Without modifying the initial description, the user
	
	can simulate a HW/software (SW) partitioning by indicating the number
	
	of processors and the processes that are to be migrated to HW. This
	
	simulation is done at the cycle-accurate level for the whole system,
	
	except for the migrated processes for which the user must provide
	
	estimated time models. The description of the processes that are
	
	selected for HW implementation must be translated into a subset of
	
	C and then synthesized. This new description is still compatible
	
	with the DPN library, so it can be used for functional validation.
	
	The temporal validation is done at the cycle-accurate level using
	
	the initial description for the SW processes and cycle-accurate models
	
	automatically generated from the C subset description for the HW
	
	processes. Disydent's strength relies on its formal- KPN model that
	
	ensures a behavior that is independent of the overall system scheduling,
	
	its fast cycle-accurate validation that is several orders of magnitude
	
	faster than classical event-driven simulators, and its single description
	
	of a process that is used as input of DPN, CASS, and UGH.},

  abstract = {Run-time communication management in a Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a
	
	challenging task. On one hand, the NoC needs to satisfy the communication
	
	requirements (e.g. throughput) of running applications competing
	
	for NoC resources. On the other hand, the NoC resources should be
	
	managed efficiently while keeping additional management functionalities
	
	minimal. This paper details a NoC communication management scheme
	
	based on a centralized, end-to-end flow control mechanism deployed
	
	in a best-effort NoC. This scheme comes at a very low resource (i.e.
	
	limited hardware and run-time overhead) cost. We show that by using
	
	a flow control mechanism it is possible, even in a best-effort NoC,
	
	to provide sufficient communication guarantees with respect to the
	
	application requirements. Finally, we illustrate the applicability
	
	of our approach for real-life multimedia applications.},

	However, standard techniques such as full just-in-time(JIT) compilation
	
	and/or adaptive optimization (AO) may not be appropriate for this
	
	type of systems due to memory and compilation overheads. The research
	
	presented in this paper proposes a technique that combines some of
	
	the main benefits of JIT compilation, superoperators( SOs) and profile-guided
	
	optimization, in order to deliver a lightweight {Java} bytecode compilation
	
	system, targeted for resource-constrained environments, that achieves
	
	runtime performance similar to that of state-of-the-art JIT/AO systems,
	
	while having a minimal impact on runtime memory consumption. The
	
	key ideas are to use profiler-selected, extended bytecode basic blocks
	
	as superoperators (new bytecode instructions) and to perform few,
	
	but very targeted, JIT/AO-like optimizations at compile time only
	
	on the superoperators? bytecode, as directed by compilation ?hints?
	
	encoded as annotations. As such, our system achieves competitive
	
	performance to a JIT/AO system, but with a much lower impact on runtime
	
	memory consumption. Moreover, it is shown that our proposed system
	
	can further improve program performance by selectively inlining method
	
	calls embedded in the chosen superoperators, as directed by runtime
	
	profiling data and with minimal impact on classfile size. For experimental
	
	evaluation, we developed three Virtual Machines( VMs) that employ
	
	the ideas presented above. The customized VMs are first compared
	
	(w.r.t. runtime performance) to a simple, fast-to-develop VM (baseline)
	
	and then to a VM that employs JIT/AO. Our best-performing system
	
	attains speedups ranging from a factor of 1.52 to a factor of 3.07,
	
	w.r.t. to the baseline VM. When compared to a state-of-the-art JIT/AO
	
	VM, our proposed system performs better for three of the benchmarks
	
	and worse by less than a factor of 2 for three others. But our SO-extended
	
	VM outperforms the JIT/AO system by a factor of 16, on average, w.r.t.

	language that has several features found in mainstream languages

	user-defined exceptions, and a realistic data and memory model. For
	
	this language we provide a concrete semantics ---characterizing both
	
	finite and infinite computations--- and a generic abstract semantics
	
	that we prove sound with respect to the concrete one. We say the
	
	abstract semantics is generic since it is designed to be completely
	
	parametric on the analysis domains: in particular, it provides support
	
	for \emph{relational} domains (i.e., abstract domains that can capture
	
	the relationships between different data objects). We also sketch

	of a statically compiled native binary. This paper evaluates the
	
	Dynamo system in the latter, more challenging situation, in order
	
	to emphasize the limits, rather than the potential, of the system.
	
	Our experiments demonstrate that even statically optimized native

	For example, the average performance of -O optimized SpecInt95 benchmark
	
	binaries created by the HP product C compiler is improved to a level

	Dynamo achieves this by focusing its efforts on optimization opportunities

	might be difficult for a static compiler to exploit. Dynamo's operation
	
	is transparent in the sense that it does not depend on any user annotations

	any special compiler, operating system or hardware support. The Dynamo
	
	prototype presented here is a realistic implementation running on

	and edge profiling, which only approximate path frequencies. Path
	
	profiles have many potential uses in program performance tuning,
	
	profile-directed compilation, and software test coverage. This paper
	
	describes a new algorithm for path profiling. This simple, fast algorithm
	
	selects and places profile instrumentation to minimize run-time overhead.
	
	Instrumented programs run with overhead comparable to the best previous
	
	profiling techniques. On the SPEC95 benchmarks, path profiling overhead
	
	averaged 31%, as compared to 16% for efficient edge profiling. Path
	
	profiling also identifies longer paths than a previous technique,
	
	which predicted paths from edge profiles (average of 88, versus 34
	
	instructions). Moreover, profiling shows that the SPEC95 train input
	
	datasets covered most of the paths executed in the ref datasets.},

  abstract = {Cache memories were invented to decouple fast processors from slow
	
	memories. However, this decoupling is only partial, and many researchers
	
	have attempted to improve cache use by program optimization. Potential
	
	benefits are significant since both energy dissipation and performance
	
	highly depend on the traffic between memory levels. But modeling
	
	the traffic is difficult; this observation has led to the use of
	
	heuristic methods for steering program transformations. In this paper,
	
	we propose another approach: we simplify the cache model and we organize
	
	the target program in such a way that an asymptotic evaluation of
	
	the memory traffic is possible. This information is used by our optimization
	
	algorithm in order to find the best reordering of the program operations,
	
	at least in an asymptotic sense. Our method optimizes both temporal
	
	and spatial locality. It can be applied to any static control program
	
	with arbitrary dependences. The optimizer has been partially implemented
	
	and applied to non-trivial programs. We present experimentalevidence
	
	that the amount of cache misses is drastically reduced with corresponding
	
	performance improvements.},

	2) no extension of the computation space is necessary. 3) By the
	
	local propagation of just one start/stop signal, energy is saved
	
	as processing elements are only active between the time they have
	
	received the start signal and the time they have received the stop
	
	signal. Our methodology is applicable to one- and multi-dimensional

	work is to explore the architectural behaviour of remote reconfigurable
	
	systems that are part of general-purpose computers. Our approach
	
	analyses various issues arising from the connection of processors
	
	with {FPGA}-based microarchitecture to an existing commodity microprocessor
	
	via a standard bus. The quantitative evaluation considers image-processing
	
	applications and shows that the maximum performance depends on the
	
	amount of data processed by the reconfigurable hardware. Taking images
	
	with 256 x 256 pixels, a moderate {FPGA} capacity of IE+5 logic blocks
	
	provides two orders of magnitude of performance improvement over
	
	a Pentium. III processor for most of our benchmarks. However, the
	
	performance benefits exhibited by reconfigurable architectures may
	
	be deeply influenced by some design parameters. This paper studies
	
	the impact of hardware capacity, reconfiguration time, memory organisation,
	
	and bus bandwidth on the performance achieved by {FPGA}-based systems.
	
	Those image-processing benchmarks that can exhibit high-performance
	
	improvement would require about 150 memory banks of 256 bytes each
	
	and a bus bandwidth as high as 30 GB/s. This quantitative approach
	
	can be applied to the design of high-performance reconfigurable coprocessors

	design. One of the first design decisions is the partitioning
	
	
	of the system in smaller subsystems, which can be
	
	
	implemented on separate hardware and/or software components.
	
	
	Internal communication within components and external
	
	
	communication between different components can be
	
	
	distinguished. Especially external communication is cumbersome,
	
	
	because it determines the requirements for the
	
	
	communication channels in the system. Distinction between
	
	
	internal and external communication is defined by the functional
	
	
	partitioning step which thus has a major impact on
	
	
	the quality of the final design. By estimating communication
	
	
	between functions in advance, we enable a better functional
	
	
	partitioning and therefore improve the communication requirements
	
	
	in the system. As in [4], Java is used in this paper
	
	
	as a specification language for the system, because this language
	
	
	is ideally fit for communication analysis. We present a
	
	
	profiler which measures communication between methods in
	
	
	Java. Our profiler counts the so called consumer-producer
	
	
	relations for each pair of methods. Each consumer-producer
	
	
	relation is defined as a pair of a read operation from and
	
	
	the corresponding write operation to the Java heap memory.
	
	
	The profiling requires a huge increase in execution
	
	
	time. To reduce this overhead, we implement reservoir sampling
	
	
	[11]. This sampling method randomly and uniformly
	
	
	selects a smaller set of read operations to be profiled. The
	
	
	size of this set, i.e. the reservoir, specifies the sampling accuracy.
	
	
	Our approach is evaluated on the SPECjvm98 benchmark
	
	
	suite. The sampling technique reduces the overhead
	
	
	by a factor of 15. Yet accuracy remains within pre-specified

	the specification and implementation of digital signal processing
	
	algorithms. The CSDF paradigm is an extension of synchronous dataflow
	
	that still allows for static scheduling and, thus, a very efficient
	
	implementation of an application. In comparison with synchronous
	
	dataflow, it is more versatile because it also supports algorithms
	
	with a cyclically changing, but predefined, behavior. Our examples
	
	show that this capability results in a higher degree of parallelism
	
	and, hence, a higher throughput, shorter delays, and less buffer
	
	memory. Moreover, they indicate that CSDF is essential for modelling
	
	prescheduled components, like application-specific integrated circuits.
	
	Besides introducing the CSDF paradigm, we also derive necessary and
	
	sufficient conditions for the schedulability of a CSDF graph. We
	
	present and compare two methods for checking the liveness of a graph.
	
	The first one checks the liveness of loops, and the second one constructs
	
	a single-processor schedule for one iteration of the graph. Once
	
	the schedulability is tested, a makespan optimal schedule on a multiprocessor
	
	can be constructed. We also introduce the heuristic scheduling method
	
	of our graphical rapid prototyping environment (GRAPE)},

	for profiling purposes. In order to ensure the instrumentation of
	
	all classes in the system, including dynamically generated or downloaded

	issues, such as bootstrapping an instrumented JDK, as well as avoiding

	description of the implementation of the design in hardware is given.
	
	Moreover, results regarding the speed of our design compared to a

	to fixed point representation, are reported. To show the applicability
	
	of the design to real life situations, a corner detection algorithm

	architectures achieve large degrees of parallelism. However, loop
	
	unrolling increases the area and can potentially have a negative
	
	impact on clock cycle time. In most embedded applications, the critical
	
	parameter is the throughput. Loop unrolling can therefore have contradictory
	
	effects on the throughput. As a consequence there exists, in general,
	
	a degree of unrolling that maximizes the throughput per unit area.
	
	
	
	This paper studies the effect of loop unrolling on the area, clock
	
	speed and throughput within the ROCCC, C to VHDL compilation framework.
	
	Our results indicate that due to the unique design of the ROCCC compilation
	
	framework, {FPGA} area either shrinks or increases at a very low
	
	rate for the first few times the loops are unrolled. This reduced
	
	area causes the clock cycle time to decrease and thus a great gain
	
	in throughput. Our results also show that there are different optimal
	
	unrolling factors for different programs.},

	our lives. The most challenging designs are safety-critical systems,
	
	such as transportation systems (e.g., airplanes, cars, and trains),
	
	industrial plants and health care monitoring. The difficulties reside
	
	in accommodating constraints both on functionality and implementation.
	
	The correct behavior must be guaranteed under diverse states of the
	
	environment and potential failures; implementation has to meet cost,
	
	size, and power consumption requirements. The design is therefore
	
	subject to extensive mathematical analysis and simulation. However,
	
	traditional models of information systems do not interface well to
	
	the continuous evolving nature of the environment in which these
	
	devices operate. Thus, in practice, different mathematical representations
	
	have to be mixed to analyze the overall behavior of the system. Hybrid
	
	systems are a particular class of mixed models that focus on the
	
	combination of discrete and continuous subsystems. There is a wealth
	
	of tools and languages that have been proposed over the years to
	
	handle hybrid systems. However, each tool makes different assumptions
	
	on the environment, resulting in somewhat different notions of hybrid
	
	system. This makes it difficult to share information among tools.
	
	Thus, the community cannot maximally leverage the substantial amount
	
	of work that has been directed to this important topic. In this paper,
	
	we review and compare hybrid system tools by highlighting their differences
	
	in terms of their underlying semantics, expressive power and mathematical
	
	mechanisms. We conclude our review with a comparative summary, which
	
	suggests the need for a unifying approach to hybrid systems design.
	
	As a step in this direction, we make the case for a semantic-aware
	
	interchange format, which would enable the use of joint techniques,
	
	make a formal comparison between different approaches possible, and
	
	facilitate exporting and importing design representations.},

	cross-file interprocedural or whole-program analyses, potentially
	
	producing much faster programs but substantially increasing the cost
	
	of compilation. Even more radical are systems that perform all compilation
	
	and optimization at run-time: such systems can optimize programs
	
	based on runtime program and system properties as well as static
	
	wholeprogram properties. However, run-time compilers (also called
	
	dynamic compilers or just-in-time compilers) suffer under severe
	
	constraints on allowable compilation time, since any time spent compiling
	
	steals from time spent running the program. None of these compilation
	
	models dominates the others: each has unique strengths and weaknesses
	
	not present in the other models.
	
	
	We are developing a new, staged compilation model which strives to
	
	combine high run-time code quality with low compilation overhead.
	
	Compilation is organized as a series of stages, with stages corresponding
	
	to, for example, separate compilation, library linking, program linking,
	
	and run-time execution. Any given optimization can be performed at
	
	any of these stages; to reduce compilation time while maintaining
	
	high effectiveness, an optimization should be performed at the earliest
	
	stage that provides the necessary program context information to
	
	carry out the optimization effectively. Moreover, a single optimization
	
	can itself be spread across multiple stages, with earlier stages
	
	performing preplanning work that enables the final stage to complete
	
	the optimization quickly. In this way, we hope to produce highly
	
	optimized programs, nearly as good as what could be done with a purely
	
	run-time compiler that had an unconstrained compilation time budget,
	
	but at a much more practical compile time cost. 
	
	
	We are building the Whirlwind optimizing compiler as the concrete

	object-oriented languages. A key component of Whirlwind is a set

	that are scalable and offer a very tight coupling between the processing
	
	resources. They are therefore quite attractive for use as compute
	
	servers for multiprogramming and parallel application workloads.
	
	Process scheduling and memory management, however, remain challenging
	
	due to the distributed main memory found on such machines. This paper
	
	examines the effects of OS scheduling and page migration policies
	
	on the performance of such compute servers. Our experiments are done
	
	on the Stanford DASH, a distributed-memory cache-coherent multiprocessor.
	
	We show that for our multiprogramming workloads consisting of sequential
	
	jobs, the traditional Unix scheduling policy does very poorly. In
	
	contrast, a policy incorporating cluster and cache affinity along
	
	with a simple page-migration algorithm offers up to two-fold performance
	
	improvement. For our workloads consisting of multiple parallel applications,
	
	we compare space-sharing policies that divide the processors among
	
	the applications to time-slicing policies such as standard Unix or
	
	gang scheduling. We show that space-sharing policies can achieve
	
	better processor utilization due to the operating point effect, but
	
	time-slicing policies benefit strongly from user-level data distribution.
	
	Our initial experience with automatic page migration suggests that

  abstract = {The first part of this paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven threshold
	
	for image denoising via wavelet soft-thresholding. The threshold
	
	is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet
	
	coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely
	
	used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is
	
	simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because
	
	it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental
	
	results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically
	
	within 5\% of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with
	
	the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and
	
	Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part
	
	of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression
	
	can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the
	
	parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising,
	
	and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically,
	
	the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous
	
	to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining
	
	coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from
	
	Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments
	
	show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly,
	
	especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization
	
	noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern
	
	to denoising},

  abstract = {The method of wavelet thresholding for removing noise, or denoising,
	
	has been researched extensively due to its effectiveness and simplicity.
	
	Much of the literature has focused on developing the best uniform
	
	threshold or best basis selection. However, not much has been done
	
	to make the threshold values adaptive to the spatially changing statistics
	
	of images. Such adaptivity can improve the wavelet thresholding performance
	
	because it allows additional local information of the image (such
	
	as the identification of smooth or edge regions) to be incorporated
	
	into the algorithm. This work proposes a spatially adaptive wavelet
	
	thresholding method based on context modeling, a common technique
	
	used in image compression to adapt the coder to changing image characteristics.
	
	Each wavelet coefficient is modeled as a random variable of a generalized
	
	Gaussian distribution with an unknown parameter. Context modeling
	
	is used to estimate the parameter for each coefficient, which is
	
	then used to adapt the thresholding strategy. This spatially adaptive
	
	thresholding is extended to the overcomplete wavelet expansion, which
	
	yields better results than the orthogonal transform. Experimental
	
	results show that spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding yields
	
	significantly superior image quality and lower MSE than the best
	
	uniform thresholding with the original image assumed known},

	in three phases. First, the profiling phase gathers a temporal data
	
	reference profile from a running program with low-overhead. Next,
	
	the profiling is turned off and a fast analysis algorithm extracts
	
	hot data streams, which are data reference sequences that frequently
	
	repeat in the same order, from the temporal profile. Then, the system
	
	dynamically injects code at appropriate program points to detect
	
	and prefetch these hot data streams. Finally, the process enters
	
	the hibernation phase where no profiling or analysis is performed,
	
	and the program continues to execute with the added prefetch instructions.
	
	At the end of the hibernation phase, the program is de-optimized
	
	to remove the inserted checks and prefetch instructions, and control
	
	returns to the profiling phase. For long-running programs, this profile,
	
	analyze and optimize, hibernate, cycle will repeat multiple times.

	computational capability is highly desirable. Achieving this goal
	
	using board-level copper interconnects in the future will become
	
	increasingly challenging owing to severe increase in high-frequency,
	
	skin-effect and dielectric loss, noise due to crosstalk, impedance
	
	mismatch, and package reflections. The solutions designed to overcome
	
	these deleterious effects require complex signal processing at the
	
	interconnect endpoints, which results in a larger power and area
	
	requirement. Optical interconnects offer a powerful alternative,
	
	potentially at a lower power. Prior work in comparing the two technologies
	
	has entailed overly simplified assumptions pertaining to either the
	
	optical or the electrical system. In this paper,we draw a more realistic
	
	power comparison with respect to the relevant parameters such as
	
	bandwidth, interconnect length and bit error rate (BER) by capturing
	
	the essential complexity in both types of interconnect systems. At
	
	the same time, we preserve the simplicity by using mostly analytical
	
	models, verified by SPICE simulations where possible. We also identify
	
	critical device and system parameters, which have a large effect
	
	on power dissipation in each type of interconnect, while quantifying
	
	the severity of their impact. For optical interconnect, these parameters
	
	are detector and modulator capacitance, responsivity, coupling efficiency
	
	and modulator type; whereas, in the case of electrical system, the
	
	critical parameters include receiver sensitivity/offset and impedance
	
	mismatch. Toward this end, we first present an optimization scheme
	
	to minimize optical interconnect power and quantify its performance
	
	as a function of future technology nodes. Next, on the electrical
	
	interconnect side, we examine the power dissipation of a state-of-the-art
	
	electrical interconnect, which uses simultaneous bidirectional signaling
	
	with transmitter equalization and on-chip noise cancellation. Finally,we
	
	draw extensive comparisons between optical and electrical interconnects.
	
	As an example, for bandwidth of 6 Gb/s at 100nmtechnology node, lengths
	
	greater than the critical length of about 43 cm yields lower power
	
	in optical interconnects. This length becomes lower (making optics
	
	more favorable) with higher data rates and lower bit error rate requirement.},

	is high variations in memory access delay depending on the ways of
	
	storing/retrieving the variables in code to/from the memories. In
	
	this paper, we propose an effective storage assignment technique

	we study the problem of DRAM memory layout for storing the non-array
	
	variables in code to achieve a maximum utilization of page and/or
	
	burst modes for the memory accesses. The contributions of our work
	
	are, for each of page and burst modes: (1) We prove that the problem
	
	is NP-hard; (2) We propose an exact formulation of the problem and
	
	efficient memory layout algorithms, called Solve-MLP for the page
	
	mode and Solve-MLB for the burst mode; >From experiments with a set

	While wavelet or subband coding of images has been shown to be superior
	
	to more traditional transform coding techniques, little attention
	
	has been paid until recently to the important issue of whether both
	
	the wavelet transforms and the subsequent coding can be implemented
	
	in low memory without significant loss in performance. We present
	
	a complete system to perform low memory wavelet image coding. Our
	
	approach is ?line-based? in that the images are read line by line
	
	and only the minimum required number of lines is kept in memory.
	
	There are two main contributions of our work. First, we introduce
	
	a line-based approach for the implementation of the wavelet transform,
	
	which yields the same results as a ?normal? implementation, but where,
	
	unlike prior work, we address memory issues arising from the need
	
	to synchronize encoder and decoder. Second, we propose a novel context-based
	
	encoder which requires no global information and stores only a local
	
	set of wavelet coefficients. This low memory coder achieves performance
	
	comparable to state of the art coders at a fraction of their memory
	
	utilization},

  abstract = {Due to its potential to greatly accelerate a wide variety of applications,
	
	reconfigurable computing has become a subject of a great deal of
	
	research. By mapping the compute-intensive sections of an application
	
	to reconfigurable hardware, custom computing systems exhibit significant
	
	speedups over traditional microprocessors. However, this potential
	
	acceleration is limited by the requirement that the speedups provided
	
	must outweigh the considerable cost of reconfiguration. The ability
	
	to relocate and defragment configurations on field programmable gate
	
	arrays ({FPGA}s) can dramatically decrease the overall reconfiguration
	
	overhead incurred by the use of the reconfigurable hardware. We therefore
	
	present hardware solutions to provide relocation and defragmentation
	
	support with a negligible area increase over a generic partially
	
	reconfigurable {FPGA}, as well as software algorithms for controlling
	
	this hardware. This results in factors of 8 to 12 improvement in
	
	the configuration overheads displayed by traditional serially programmed

	scratchpad memory. Memory reuse is well-understood for allocating
	
	registers to hold scalar variables. Its extension to arrays has been
	
	studied recently for multimedia applications, for loop parallelization,
	
	and for circuit synthesis from recurrence equations. In all such
	
	studies, the introduction of modulo operations to an otherwise affine
	
	mapping (of loop or array indices to memory locations) achieves the
	
	desired reuse. We develop here a new mathematical framework, based
	
	on critical lattices, that subsumes the previous approaches and provides
	
	new insight. We first consider the set of indices that conflict,
	
	those that cannot be mapped to the same memory cell. Next, we construct
	
	the set of differences of conflicting indices. We establish a correspondence
	
	between a valid modular mapping and a strictly admissible integer
	
	lattice?one having no nonzero element in common with the set of conflicting
	
	index differences. The memory required by an optimal modular mapping
	
	is equal to the determinant of the corresponding lattice. The memory
	
	reuse problem is thus reduced to the (still interesting and nontrivial)
	
	problem of finding a strictly admissible integer lattice of least
	
	determinant. We then propose and analyze several practical strategies
	
	for finding strictly admissible integer lattices, either optimal
	
	or optimal up to a multiplicative factor, and, hence, memory-saving
	
	modular mappings. We explain and analyze previous approaches in terms
	
	of our new framework.},

	wavelet transform or two band subband filtering with finite filters
	
	can be decomposed into a finite sequence of simple filtering steps,
	
	which we call lifting steps but that are also known as ladder structures.
	
	This decomposition corresponds to a factorization of the polyphase
	
	matrix of the wavelet or subband filters into elementary matrices.
	
	That such a factorization is possible is well-known to algebraists
	
	(and expressed by the formula SL(n;R[z,1/z]) = E(n; R[z,1/z])); it
	
	is also used in linear systems theory in the electrical engineering
	
	community. We present here a self-contained derivation, building
	
	the decomposition from basic principles such as the Euclidean algorithm,
	
	with a focus on applying it to wavelet filtering. This factorization
	
	provides an alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage
	
	that it can also be used in the biorthogonal, i.e, non-unitary case.
	
	Like the lattice factorization, the decomposition presented here
	
	asymptotically reduces the computational complexity of the transform
	
	by a factor two. It has other applications, such as the possibility
	
	of defining a wavelet-like transform that maps integers to integers.},

  abstract = {Advances in operating systems and languages have brought the ideal
	
	of reasonably-bounded execution time closer to developers who need
	
	such assurances for real-time and embedded systems applications.
	
	Recently, extensions to the {Java} libraries and virtual machine
	
	have been proposed in an emerging standard, which provides for specification
	
	of release times, execution costs, and deadlines for a restricted
	
	class of threads. To use such features, the code executing in the
	
	thread must never reference storage that could be subject to garbage
	
	collection. The new standard provides for regionlike, stack-allocated
	
	areas (scopes) of storage that are ignored by garbage collection
	
	and deallocated en masse. It now falls to the developer to adapt
	
	ordinary {Java} code to use the real-time {Java} scoped memory regions.
	
	Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine manually how to map object
	
	instantiations to scopes. Moreover, if ordinary {Java} code is modified
	
	to effect instantiations in scopes, the resulting code is difficult
	
	to read, maintain, and reuse. Static analysis can yield scopes that
	
	are correct across all program executions, but such analysis is necessarily
	
	conservative in nature. If too many objects appear to live forever
	
	under such analysis, then developers cannot rely on static analysis
	
	alone to form reasonable scopes. In this paper we present an approach
	
	for automatically determining appropriate storage scopes for {Java}
	
	objects, based on dynamic analysis?observed object lifetimes and
	
	object referencing behavior. While such analysis is perhaps unsafe
	
	across all program executions, our analysis can be coupled with static
	
	analysis to bracket object lifetimes, with the truth lying somewhere
	
	in between. We provide experimental results that show the memory
	
	regions discovered by our technique.},

	hardware are chosen only when the required performance or energy-efficiency
	
	cannot be met with a software solution. The performance of a hardware
	
	design critically depends upon having high levels of parallelism
	
	and data locality. Often a long sequence of high-level transformations
	
	is needed to sufficiently increase the locality and parallelism.
	
	The effect of the transformations is known only after translating
	
	the high-level code into a specific design at the circuit level.
	
	When the constraints are not met, hardware designers need to redo
	
	the high-level loop transformations, and repeat all subsequent translation
	
	steps, which leads to long design times.
	
	
	We propose a method to reduce design time through the synergistic
	
	combination of techniques (a) to quickly pinpoint the loop transformations
	
	that increase locality; (b) to refactor loops in a polyhedral model
	
	and check whether a sequence of refactorings is legal; (c) to generate
	
	efficient structural VHDL from the optimized refactored algorithm.
	
	
	The implementation of these techniques in a tool suite results in
	
	a far shorter design time of hours instead of days or weeks. A 2D-inverse
	
	discrete wavelet transform was taken as a case study. The results
	
	outperform those of a commercial C-to-VHDL compiler, and compare

  abstract = {Multimedia applications are examples of a class of algorithms that
	
	are both calculation and data intensive and have real-time requirements.
	
	As a result dedicated hardware acceleration is often needed. Usually
	
	the on-chip memory is not sufficient to store all data and has to
	
	be extended with external memory. The bandwidth to this memory often
	
	becomes a bottle neck. Loop transformations are needed to reduce
	
	this bandwidth, by improving the temporal and spatial data locality.
	
	They can also unveil the parallelism present in the algorithm. The
	
	polyhedral model offers a flexible program representation that allows
	
	to automate this kind of transformations. The class of applications
	
	that can be transformed with the polyhedral model fits very well
	
	into the class of applications that can benefit from hardware acceleration.
	
	This paper describes how the existing tools, that generate software
	
	from a polyhedral program representation, have been extended to generate
	
	a VHDL description of a hardware controller. The corresponding data
	
	path is generated semi-automatically. Combining the generation of
	
	controller and data path creates a fast path to hardware. Our techniques
	
	enable an easy exploration of the design space, by generating a lot
	
	of implementation variants. The techniques are demonstrated on an
	
	inverse discrete wavelet transform resulting in several synthesizable
	
	designs, of which one has been hand-optimized towards a {FPGA} implementation.
	
	The results outperform those of a commercial C-to-VHDL compiler.
	
	The generated variants run 5 to 10 times faster while consuming less
	
	resources.},

	1 Introduction
	
	
	Reconfigurable computing systems gain more and more interest in recent
	
	years.
	
	
	FCCM = FPGA Custom Computing Machine
	
	
	FCCM: High perf, difficult to program
	
	
	
	Here: SUNthesis project (Second University of Naples synthesis)
	
	
	Goal: Design and develop automatic compilation framework C -> VHDL
	
	(various synthesizable designs)
	
	
	Auto C-wrapping functions for communication with pc.
	
	
	
	Uses transformation-intensive branch-and-bound methodology to explore
	
	design space.
	
	
	
	Synthesis techniques based on repeated and extensive application of
	
	data-flow graph trafos were demonstrated in the past to be time-consuming
	
	[no ref].
	
	
	This approach: fast because estimation of time-area early in design
	
	process (before time consuming process of low-level sythesis)
	
	
	
	Related:
	
	
	Pipeline vectorization [2]: loop-reord left to designer, only inner
	
	loops parallelized.
	
	
	Cameron [13]: uses SA-C (language specifically designed for hardware

	2 The Synthesis Technique
	
	
	Focus on loops.
	
	
	Limited number of hardware resources.
	
	
	Proposed technique: perfect loop nest, dependences representable as
	
	distance vectors, loop bounds as linear functions of outermost indices.
	
	
	Choice of trafos (after legality verification is directed by optimizing(cost-function))

  abstract = {Improving program locality has become increasingly important on modern
	
	computer systems. An effective strategy is to group computations
	
	on the same data so that once the data are loaded into cache, the
	
	program performs all their operations before the data are evicted.
	
	However, computation regrouping is difficult to automate for programs
	
	with complex data and control structures. This paper studies the
	
	potential of locality improvement through trace-driven computation
	
	regrouping. First, it shows that maximizing the locality is different
	
	from maximizing the parallelism or maximizing the cache utilization.
	
	The problem is NP-hard even without considering data dependences
	
	and cache organization. Then the paper describes a tool that performs
	
	constrained computation regrouping on program traces. The new tool
	
	is unique because it measures the exact control dependences and applies
	
	complete memory renaming and re-allocation. Using the tool, the paper
	
	measures the potential locality improvement in a set of commonly
	
	used benchmark programs written in C.},

	The high level synthesis for dedicated coprocessor is a very complex
	
	problem. It has to cope with different aims like the working frequency,
	
	the surface, the consumption, etc... These criteria specify the generated
	
	circuit and the high level synthesis tool efficiency. This Ph.D thesis
	
	presents a two steps approach in the high level synthesis. In the
	
	first step, we minimize the surface and maximize the parallelism.
	
	In the second step, the circuit is modified to take in account the
	
	electrical characteristics and to fetch the wanted working frequency.
	
	The synthesis tool has to optimize the circuit on a very few number
	
	of criteria which are specified by the designer. By the way, for
	
	the data control dominated circuits, the aim can't be qualified by
	
	a global guidance, because a such guidance is unadapted and can't
	
	qualify the optimization level. The collateral effects on the other
	
	characteristics of the circuit aren't controlled by the designer.
	
	The respect of the global guidance is difficult to reach by the synthesis
	
	algorithms. The scheduling, allocation and binding phases of the
	
	high level synthesis are NP-complex. Most of these problems are solved
	
	with heuristics which have unpredictable consequences on the circuit
	
	characteristics. The automation of the high level synthesis needs
	
	a very precise description of the designer's attempts. We are studying
	
	in this Ph.D thesis the necessary guidances to precisely aim a solution
	
	and keep the compatibility with our two-phases approach. We have
	
	to reduce the guidance definition to facilitate the designer's work
	
	and be aware of the loss of efficiency which has been induced.},

  abstract = {SGI recently introduced the Altix 3700. In contrast to previous SGI
	
	systems, the Altix uses a modified version of the open source Linux
	
	operating system and the latest Intel IA-64 processors, the Intel
	
	Itanium2. The Altix also uses the next generation SGI interconnect,
	
	Numalink3 and NUMAflex, which provides a NUMA, cache-coherent, shared
	
	memory, multi-processor system. In this paper, we present a performance
	
	evaluation of the SGI Altix using microbenchmarks, kernels, and mission
	
	applications. We find that the Altix provides many advantages over
	
	other non-vector machines and it is competitive with the Cray X1
	
	on a number of kernels and applications. The Altix also shows good
	
	scaling, and its globally shared memory allows users convenient parallelization
	
	with OpenMP or pthreads.},

  abstract = {Bezier representations have been widely employed as a standard way
	
	of designing complex scenes with very good quality results. These
	
	surfaces are usually tessellated, in the software application, into
	
	triangle models to be rendered. Then, the final image is generated
	
	in the graphics card so that its triangle rendering capabilities
	
	are exploited. In this work we present an adaptive tessellation algorithm
	
	and the corresponding architecture to be implemented in hardware.
	
	The objective of the proposal is to avoid the potential bottleneck
	
	associated with the transmission of complex triangular models from
	
	CPU to graphics cards. The algorithm we propose is based on a layer
	
	strip representation method and a new data management that permits
	
	generation and efficient storage of the tessellated mesh. The corresponding
	
	architecture has to be included as an additional unit at the input
	
	of the graphics card. As a consequence, the transmission requirements
	
	from CPU to graphics card are greatly reduced as the tessellation
	
	is performed in the graphics card. On the other hand, the adaptive
	
	strategy employed permits selection of the number of triangles of
	
	the final mesh as a trade off between computational requirements
	
	and quality of the final mesh. The efficient data management proposed,
	
	together with the low storage requirements of the architecture, makes
	
	it a good candidate for its hardware implementation and inclusion
	
	in future graphics cards.},

	Due to their special status within the language infrastructure, the
	
	<i>standard class libraries</i>, also known as <i>system classes</i>
	
	provided by most contemporary object-oriented languages are difficult
	
	and sometimes impossible to instrument. If instrumented, the use
	
	of their rewritten versions within the instrumentation code is usually
	
	unavoidable. However, this is equivalent to `instrumenting the instrumentation',

	strategy that alleviates the above problems by renaming the instrumented
	
	classes. The proposed approach does not require any modifications
	
	to the language, compiler or runtime. It allows system classes to
	
	be instrumented both statically and dynamically. In fact, this is
	
	the first technique that enables dynamic instrumentation of {Java}
	
	system classes without modification of any runtime components. We
	
	demonstrate our approach by implementing two instrumentation-based
	
	systems: a memory profiler and a distributed runtime for {Java}.},

	parallelization. A schedule gives a blueprint for constructing a

	constructing a schedule entails solving a large linear program. Even

	two methods for improving this situation. Firstly, a big program
	
	can be divided into smaller units (processes) which can be scheduled
	
	separately. This is modular scheduling. Second, one can use projection
	
	methods for solving linear programming problems incrementally. This

	In Very Long Instruction Word machines, many statically scheduled,

	more parallel machines of this type; but until trace scheduling we
	
	didn't know how to generate code for them. Trace scheduling finds
	
	sufficient parallelism in ordinary code to justify thinking about

  abstract = {We perform a thorough data dependence and localization analysis for
	
	the discrete wavelet transform algorithm and then use it to synthesize
	
	distributed memory and control architectures for its parallel computation.
	
	The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is characterized by a nonuniform
	
	data dependence structure owing to the decimation operation it is
	
	neither a uniform recurrence equation (URE) nor an affine recurrence
	
	equation (ARE) and consequently cannot be transformed directly using
	
	linear space-time mapping methods into efficient array architectures.
	
	Our approach is to apply first appropriate nonlinear transformations
	
	operating on the algorithm's index space, leading to a new DWT formulation
	
	on which application of linear space-time mapping can become effective.
	
	The first transformation of the algorithm achieves regularization
	
	of interoctave dependencies but alone does not lead to efficient
	
	array solutions after the mapping due to limitations associated with
	
	transforming the three-dimensional (3-D) algorithm onto one-dimensional
	
	(1-D) arrays, which is also known as multiprojection. The second
	
	transformation is introduced to remove the need for multiprojection
	
	by formulating the regularized DWT algorithm in a two-dimensional
	
	(2-D) index space. Using this DWT formulation, we have synthesized
	
	two VLSI-amenable linear arrays of LPEs computing a 6-octave DWT
	
	decomposition with latencies of M and 2M-1, respectively, where L
	
	is the wavelet filter length, and M is the number of samples in the
	
	data sequence. The arrays are modular, regular, use simple control,
	
	and can be easily extended to larger L and J. The latency of both
	
	arrays is independent of the highest octave J, and the efficiency
	
	is nearly 100\% for any M with one design achieving the lowest possible
	
	latency of M},

	we present a mapping of the Wavelet Transform to ADI's dual-core
	
	Blackfin 561. We do a coarse data-level split of a previous implementation
	
	on a single-core Blackfin 533 with cache. Unfortunately, doing so
	
	we observe only a marginal speed-up due to memory access inefficiencies.
	
	This problem is addressed in three steps: first we replace local
	
	caches by a software-controlled scratchpad memory filled using DMA
	
	transfers. Next we let one core schedule these transfers for both
	
	cores. Finally we modify the transfers to avoid page misses to SDRAM.
	
	All these steps result in a x1.86 speed-up against a single-core
	
	version, or equivalently a 40\% power saving at the same performance,
	
	showing how efficient data-level parallelization on a multi-core

	is affected by various factors such as the Java application, its
	
	input, the virtual machine, the garbage collector, the heap size,
	
	etc. In addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the execution
	
	time of a Java program to differ from run to run.There are a number
	
	of sources of non-determinism such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
	
	and optimization in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timer-based
	
	method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection, and various
	
	system effects. There exist a wide variety of Java performance evaluation
	
	methodologies used by researchers and benchmarkers. These methodologies
	
	differ from each other in a number of ways. Some report average performance
	
	over a number of runs of the same experiment; others report the best
	
	or second best performance observed; yet others report the worst.
	
	Some iterate the benchmark multiple times within a single VM invocation;
	
	others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate a single benchmark
	
	execution; yet others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate
	
	the benchmark multiple times. This paper shows that prevalent methodologies
	
	can be misleading, and can even lead to incorrect conclusions. The
	
	reason is that the data analysis is not statistically rigorous. In
	
	this paper, we present a survey of existing Java performance evaluation
	
	methodologies and discuss the importance of statistically rigorous
	
	data analysis for dealing with non-determinism. We advocate approaches
	
	to quantify startup as well as steady-state performance, and, in
	
	addition, we provide the JavaStats software to automatically obtain
	
	performance numbers in a rigorous manner. Although this paper focuses
	
	on Java performance evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this
	
	paper also apply to other programming languages and systems that

  abstract = {In the past decade, real-time embedded systems have become much more
	
	complex due to the introduction of a lot of new functionality in
	
	one application, and due to running multiple applications concurrently.
	
	This increases the dynamic nature of today's applications and systems,
	
	and tightens the requirements for their constraints in terms of deadlines
	
	and energy consumption. State-of-the-art design methodologies try
	
	to cope with these novel issues by identifying several most used
	
	cases and dealing with them separately, reducing the newly introduced
	
	complexity. This article presents a generic and systematic design-time/run-time
	
	methodology for handling the dynamic nature of modern embedded systems,
	
	which can be utilized by existing design methodologies to increase
	
	their efficiency. It is based on the concept of system scenarios,
	
	which group system behaviors that are similar from a multidimensional
	
	cost perspective?such as resource requirements, delay, and energy
	
	consumption?in such a way that the system can be configured to exploit
	
	this cost similarity. At design-time, these scenarios are individually
	
	optimized. Mechanisms for predicting the current scenario at run-time,
	
	and for switching between scenarios, are also derived. This design
	
	trajectory is augmented with a run-time calibration mechanism, which
	
	allows the system to learn on-the-fly during its execution, and to
	
	adapt itself to the current input stimuli, by extending the scenario
	
	set, changing the scenario definitions, and both the prediction and
	
	switching mechanisms. To show the generality of our methodology,
	
	we show how it has been applied on four very different real-life
	
	design problems. In all presented case studies, substantial energy
	
	reductions were obtained by exploiting scenarios.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces methods for extending the classical systolic
	
	synthesis methodology to multidimensional time. Multi-dimensional
	
	scheduling enables complex algorithms that do not admit linear schedules
	
	to be parallelized, but it requires the use of memories in the architecture.
	
	The synthesis of such an architecture requires the definition of
	
	an allocation function that maps the calculations on the processors,
	
	and memory functions that define where the data are stored during
	
	execution. As our approach targets custom VLSI architectures, we
	
	constrain the synthesis method to produce parallel architectures
	
	that that satisfy the computer owns rule, i.e., each processor computes
	
	the data which are stored in its local memory. We explain how to
	
	combine the allocation and memory functions in order to meet the
	
	computer owns rule, and we present an original mechanism for controlling
	
	the operation of the architecture. We detail the different steps
	
	needed to generate a HDL description of the architecture, and we
	
	illustrate our method on the matrix multiplication algorithm. We
	
	describe a structural VHDL program that has been derived and synthesized
	
	for a {FPGA} platform using these design principles. Our results
	
	show that the complexity added in each processor by the memories
	
	and the control is moderate and justifies in practice the use of
	
	such architectures.},

	used in image processing, image compression, pattern recognition
	
	and digital signal processing. This problem is more acute in reconfigurable

	on the reconfigurable fabric ({FPGA}) to minimize the required memory

	a compile-time approach to reuse data in window-based codes. The

	in C. It then computes the size of the hardware buffer and defines
	
	three sets of data values for each window: the window set, the managed

	HDL code generation and improves the resulting hardware performance.

	presents an analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, at the architecture

	that can be exploited on the {FPGA} is a big component. By itself,
	
	however, it does not account for the whole speedup.In this paper
	
	we experimentally analyze the remaining components of the speedup.
	
	We compare the performance of image processing application programs
	
	executing in hardware on a Xilinx Virtex E2000 {FPGA} to that on
	
	three general-purpose processor platforms: MIPS, Pentium III and
	
	VLIW. The question we set out to answer is what is the inherent advantage

	one hand, the clock frequency of general-purpose processors is about
	
	20 times that of typical {FPGA} implementations. On the other hand,
	
	the iteration level parallelism on the {FPGA} is one to two orders
	
	of magnitude that on the CPUs. In addition to these two factors,
	
	we identify the efficiency advantage of {FPGA}s as an important factor
	
	and show that it ranges from 6 to 47 on our test benchmarks. We also
	
	identify some of the components of this factor: the streaming of
	
	data from memory, the overlap of control and data flow and the elimination
	
	of some instruction on the {FPGA}. The results provide a deeper understanding

  abstract = {In many parallel applications, each computation entity (process, thread
	
	etc.) switches the bulk of its communication between a small group
	
	of other entities. We call this phenomenon switching locality. The
	
	Interconnection Cached Network (ICN) is a reconfigurable network
	
	especially suited for exploiting switching locality. It consists
	
	of many small, fast crossbars interconnected by a large, slow switching
	
	crossbar. The large crossbar is used for topology reconfiguration
	
	and the smaller crossbars for circuit switching. For a large class
	
	of communication patterns displaying switching locality (this includes
	
	meshes, tori, trees, rings, pyramids, etc.), it is possible to choose
	
	appropriate ICN configurations and assignments of processes to processors
	
	such that all communication paths pass through two or less switching
	
	components. Much of the previous work on performance analysis of
	
	networks has assumed random, uniformly distributed communication
	
	and is inapplicable to many real-life parallel applications that
	
	lack this uniformity. We develop a methodology to analyze the performance
	
	of synchronous, circuit switched networks under different communication
	
	traffic patterns. We employ this methodology to study the performance
	
	of the ICN in comparison to more popular reconfigurable networks:
	
	the delta and the crossbar. We choose two different communication
	
	patterns -- a 2-D torus representing a high degree of switching locality
	
	and a fully connected graph representing complete absence of such
	
	locality. We show that in the presence of locality, the ICN comes
	
	very close to matching the crossbar's performance. This, together
	
	with the shorter network cycle period of the ICN, makes it more desirable.
	
	In the absence of switching locality, the reconfigurability of the
	
	ICN allows for a graceful degradation in performance.},

  abstract = {Many computationally-intensive programs, such as those for differential
	
	equations, spatial interpolation, and dynamic programming, spend
	
	a large portion of their execution time in multiply-nested loops
	
	that have a regular stencil of data dependences. Tiling is a well-known
	
	compiler optimization that improves performance on such loops, particularly
	
	for computers with a multileveled hierarchy of parallelism and memory.
	
	Most previous work on tiling is limited in at least one of the following
	
	ways: they only handle nested loops of depth two, orthogonal tiling,
	
	or rectangular tiles. In our work, we tile loop nests of arbitrary
	
	depth using polyhedral tiles. We derive a prediction formula for
	
	the execution time of such tiled loops, which can be used by a compiler
	
	to automatically determine the tiling parameters that minimizes the
	
	execution time. We also explain the notion of rise, a measure of
	
	the relationship between the shape of the tiles and the shape of
	
	the iteration space generated by the loop nest. The rise is a powerful
	
	tool in predicting the execution time of a tiled loop. It allows
	
	us to reason about how the tiling affects the length of the longest
	
	path of dependent tiles, which is a measure of the execution time
	
	of a tiling. We use a model of the tiled iteration space that allows
	
	us to determine the length of the longest path of dependent tiles
	
	using linear programming. Using the rise, we derive a simple formula
	
	for the length of the longest path of dependent tiles in rectilinear
	
	iteration spaces, a subclass of the convex iteration spaces, and
	
	show how to choose the optimal tile shape.},

	are described.
	
	
	In May 2002, the ES was acknowledged to be the most powerful computer
	
	in the world: 35.86 teraflop/s for the LINPACK HPC benchmark and
	
	26.58 teraflop/s for an atmospheric general circulation code (AFES).
	
	Such a remarkable performance may be attributed to the following
	
	three architectural features; vector processor, shared-memory and
	
	high-bandwidth non-blocking interconnection crossbar network.
	
	
	The ES consists of 640 processor nodes (PN) and an interconnection
	
	network (IN), which are housed in 320 PN cabinets and 65 IN cabinets.
	
	The ES is installed in a specially designed building, 65 m long,
	
	50 m wide and 17 m high. In order to accomplish this advanced system,
	
	many kinds of hardware technologies have been developed, such as
	
	a high-density and high-frequency LSI, a high-frequency signal transmission,
	
	a high-density packaging, and a high-efficiency cooling and power
	
	supply system with low noise so as to reduce whole volume of the
	
	ES and total power consumption.
	
	
	For highly parallel processing, a special synchronization means connecting
	
	all nodes, Global Barrier Counter (GBC), has been introduced.},

	1982. This paper introduces an alternative view of the relationship
	
	between scalable technologies and SMPs. Instead of replacing large
	
	SMPs with scalable technology, we propose new scalable techniques
	
	that allow large SMPs to be tied together efficiently, while maintaining
	
	the compatibility with, and performance characteristics of, an SMP.
	
	The trade-offs of such an architecture differ from those of traditional,
	
	scalable, Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (cc-NUMA) approaches.WildFire
	
	is a distributed shared-memory (DSM) prototype implementation based
	
	on large SMPs. It relies on two techniques for creating application-transparent
	
	locality: Coherent Memory Replication (CMR), which is a variation
	
	of Simple COMA/Reactive NUMA, and Hierarchical Affinity Scheduling
	
	(HAS). These two optimizations create extra node locality, which
	
	blurs the node boundaries to an application such that SMP-like performance
	
	can be achieved with no NUMA-specific optimizations.We present a
	
	performance study of a large OLTP benchmark running on DSMs built
	
	from various-sized nodes and with varying amounts of application-transparent
	
	locality. WildFire's measured performance is shown to be more than
	
	two times that of an unoptimized NUMA implementation built from small
	
	nodes and within 13\% of the performance of the ideal implementation:
	
	a large SMP with the same access time to its entire shared memory
	
	as the local memory access time of WildFire.},

	machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification

	real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units.
	
	Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition
	
	diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively,
	
	with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These
	
	transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured
	
	and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact
	
	and expressivesmall diagrams can express complex behavioras
	
	well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities
	
	of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description
	
	at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications
	
	manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate
	
	here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against
	
	conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification
	
	by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can
	
	be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part
	
	of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's
	
	other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification.
	
	We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the
	
	last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification
	
	of a particularly complex system.},

  abstract = {Parallel processing in computer systems is gaining importance: not
	
	only supercomputers, but today also desktop and laptop computers
	
	have multiple processors. To make all these processors work efficiently
	
	on a single problem, they have to communicate. To this end, processors
	
	are connected to each other, and to the outside world, through a
	
	communication network. This network should allow a fast exchange
	
	of information, such that the processors receive new data to process
	
	in a timely manner. Current technologies, using electrical signaling,
	
	are reaching the end of their capabilities, however. Moreover, the
	
	traffic on such networks is very irregular, making some parts of
	
	the network highly saturated while other parts are barely used. The
	
	precise patterns also depend on the application, and can even change
	
	during the run time of a single application. This makes it very difficult
	
	to build an efficient communication network. This doctoral dissertation
	
	explores the possibilities of optical, reconfigurable networks. Optical
	
	connections are one part of the solution to the communication problem,
	
	since they allow for much higher data rates. Moreover, optics allows
	
	the network to be reconfigured, during the course of a program, in
	
	a data-transparent way, to the current traffic patterns. This way,
	
	all network connections are utilized more efficiently, which can
	
	both increase the network`s performance and reduce power usage.},

	The JMTP architecture is a single chip containing an off-the-shelf
	
	general purpose processor core coupled with an array of {Java} Thread
	
	Processors (JTPs). Performance can be improved using this architecture
	
	by exploiting coarse-grained parallelism in the application. These

	JTP thread timing constraints or provide an early warning for a timing

	and implicit coarse-grained concurrent threads to execute on JTPs.
	
	This framework identifies the optimal mapping of an application to
	
	a JMTP with an arbitrary number of JTPs. We have tested this framework
	
	on a variety of applications including IDEA encryption with different
	
	JTP configurations and confirmed that the algorithm was able to obtain

	system design, especially in the rapidly growing market of mobile
	
	handbeld computing, communication, internet devices that are driven
	
	by battery power. It is of paramount importance to estimate and optimize
	
	power of those systems during an early design stage at a high level
	
	of abstraction in order to efficiently explore the design space and
	
	to take full advantage of the related high optimization potential.
	
	
	
	In this paper, we present Avalanche, a prototyping framework that
	
	addresses the issues of power estimation and optimization for mixed
	
	hardware and software embedded systems. Avalanche is based on a generic
	
	embedded system architecture consisting of embedded CPU, custom hardware,
	
	and a memory hierarchy. For system-level power estimation, given
	
	various system parameters like cache sizes, cache policies, and bus
	
	width, etc., Avalanche is able to rapidly evaluate/estimate power
	
	and performance and thus facilitate comprehensive design space explorations.
	
	For system-level power optimization, Avalanche offers different modes
	
	reflecting various design scenarios: if no hardware/software partitioning
	
	or only partial partitioning has been conducted, Avalanche guides
	
	the designer in finding power-aware hardware/software partitioning;
	
	when a system has already been partitioned, Avalanche can optimize
	
	system parameters such as cache and memory size; if system parameters
	
	and partitioning are given, Avalanche applies additional optimizations
	
	for power including source-to-source compiler transformations.
	
	
	Avalanche has been deployed during the design phase of real-world
	
	applications including an MPEG 11 encoder in a set-top box design.
	
	Extensive design space explorations in terms of power and performance
	
	could be conducted within several hours and various optimization
	
	techniques led to power reductions of up to 94 \% without performance
	
	losses and only a slight increases in total chip size (i.e., transistor
	
	count).},

	the best performance. For example, generational garbage collectors
	
	partition objects by age and focus their efforts on the youngest
	
	objects. Partitioning by age works well for many programs because
	
	younger objects usually have short lifetimes and thus garbage collection
	
	of young objects is often able to free up many objects. However,
	
	generational garbage collectors are typically much less efficient
	
	for longer-lived objects, and thus prior work has proposed many enhancements
	
	to generational collection.
	
	
	Our work explores whether the connectivity of objects can yield useful
	
	partitions or improve existing partitioning schemes. We look at both
	
	direct (e.g., object A points to object B) and transitive (e.g.,
	
	object A is reachable from object B) connectivity. Our results indicate
	
	that connectivity correlates strongly with object lifetimes and deathtimes
	
	and is therefore likely to be useful for partitioning objects.},

  abstract = {The operation-centric hardware abstraction is useful for describing
	
	systems whose behavior exhibits a high degree of concurrency. In
	
	the operation-centric style, the behavior of a system is described
	
	as a collection of operations on a set of state elements. Each operation
	
	is specified as a predicate and a set of simultaneous state-element
	
	updates, which may only take effect in case the predicate is true
	
	on the current state values. The effect of an operation's state updates
	
	is atomic, that is, the legal behaviors of the system constitute
	
	some sequential interleaving of the operations. This atomic and sequential
	
	execution semantics permits each operation to be formulated as if
	
	the rest of the system were frozen and thus simplifies the description
	
	of concurrent systems. This paper presents an approach to synthesize
	
	an efficient synchronous digital implementation from an operation-centric
	
	hardware-design description. The resulting implementation carries
	
	out multiple operations per clock cycle and yet maintains the semantics
	
	that is consistent with the atomic and sequential execution of operations.
	
	The paper defines, and then gives algorithms to identify, conflict-free
	
	and sequentially composable operations that can be performed in the
	
	same clock cycle. The paper further gives an algorithm to generate
	
	the hardwired arbitration logic to coordinate the concurrent execution
	
	of conflict-free and sequentially composable operations. Lastly,
	
	the paper evaluates synthesis results based on the TRAC compiler
	
	for the TRSPEC operation-centric hardware-description language. The
	
	results from a pipelined processor example show that an operation-centric
	
	framework offers a significant reduction in design time, while achieving
	
	comparable implementation quality as traditional register-transfer-level
	
	design flows.},

	The high-contrast subwavelength grating reflector enables a drastic

	These applications are important in defining the design and performance
	
	decisions of future high performance microprocessors. This paper
	
	presents a detailed data-sharing analysis and chip-multiprocessor
	
	(CMP) cache study of several multi-threaded data-mining bioinformatics
	
	workloads. For a CMP with a three-level cache hierarchy, we model
	
	the last-level of the cache hierarchy as either multiple private
	
	caches or a single cache shared amongst different cores of the CMP.
	
	Our experiments show that the bioinformatics workloads exhibit significant
	
	data-sharing -- 50-95\% of the data cache is shared by the different
	
	threads of the workload. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of
	
	data cache shared, for some workloads, as many as 98\% of the accesses
	
	to the last-level cache are to shared data cache lines. Additionally,
	
	the amount of data-sharing exhibited by the workloads is a function
	
	of the total cache size available -- the larger the data cache the
	
	better the sharing behavior. Thus, partitioning the available last-level
	
	cache silicon area into multiple private caches can cause applications
	
	to lose their inherent data-sharing behavior. For the workloads in
	
	this study, a shared 32MB last-level cache is able to capture a tremendous
	
	amount of data-sharing and outperform a 32MB private cache configuration
	
	by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, with shared last-level
	
	caches, the bandwidth demands beyond the last-level cache can be
	
	reduced by factors of 3-625 when compared to private last-level caches.},

	consists of a small number of libraries and intrinsic functions added
	
	to a synthesizable subset of C, and supports a communicating process
	
	programming model. The processes may be either software or hardware
	
	processes, and the compiler manages communication among the processes
	
	transparently to the programmer. For the hardware processes, the
	
	compiler generates Register-Transfer-Level (RTL) VHDL, targeting
	
	multiple FPGAs with dedicated memories. For the software processes,
	
	a multi-threaded software program is generated.The Streams-C language
	
	and compiler offer a very high level of expressivity for reconfigurable
	
	computing application development, particularly for stream-processing
	
	applications. We find this is reflected in productivity, for a factor
	
	of up to 10 times improvement in time to produce a program. However,
	
	use of the tool in the ``real world'' is predicated on performance:
	
	only if such a compiler can deliver performance comparable to hand-coded
	
	performance will it be used in practice.This paper presents an application
	
	study of the Streams-C compiler. Four applications have been written
	
	in Streams-C and compiled to the AMC Wildforce board containing Xilinx
	
	4036's. Those same applications have been hand-coded in a combination
	
	of RTL and structural VHDL. We compare performance of the generated
	
	code with the hand-optimized code. Our study shows that the compiler-generated
	
	designs are 1.37--4 times the area and $1/2$--1 times the clock frequency
	
	of the hand designs. We find that the compiler, based on the SUIF
	
	infrastructure, can be greatly improved through various standard
	
	compiler optimizations that are not currently being exploited. Thus
	
	we are currently re-writing a public domain version of Streams-C

	performance of a sequence of loop nests through a combination of
	
	loop and data layout transformations. Pure loop transformations are
	
	restricted by data dependencies and may not be very successful in
	
	optimizing imperfectly nested loops and explicitly parallelized programs.
	
	Although pure data transformations are not constrained by data dependencies,
	
	the impact of a data transformation on an array might be program-wide;
	
	that is, it can affect all the references to that array in all the
	
	loop nests. Therefore, in this paper we argue for an integrated approach
	
	that employs both loop and data transformations. The method enjoys
	
	the advantages of most of the previous techniques for enhancing locality
	
	and is efficient. In our approach, the loop nests in a program are
	
	processed one by one and the data layout constraints obtained from
	
	one nest are propagated for optimizing the remaining loop nests.
	
	We show a simple and effective matrix-based framework to implement
	
	this process. The search space that we consider for possible loop
	
	transformations can be represented by general nonsingular linear
	
	transformation matrices and the data layouts that we consider are
	
	those that can be expressed using hyperplanes. Experiments with several
	
	floating-point programs on an 8-processor SGI Origin 2000 distributed-shared-memory

	in embedded systems are extremely important. Using a suitable combination
	
	of program transformations and memory design space exploration aimed
	
	at enhancing data locality enables significant reductions in effective
	
	memory access latencies. While numerous compiler optimizations have

	an optimization suite that uses loop and data transformations, an
	
	on-chip memory partitioning step, and a code-rewriting phase that
	
	collectively transform an input code automatically to take advantage

	the performance of programs written in the {Java} programming language.
	
	The standard technique for {Java} execution is interpretation, which
	
	provides for extensive portability of programs. A {Java} interpreter
	
	dynamically executes {Java} bytecodes, which comprise the instruction
	
	set of the {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM). Execution time performance
	
	of {Java} programs can be improved through compilation, possibly
	
	at the expense of portability. Various types of {Java} compilers
	
	have been proposed, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that compile
	
	bytecodes into native processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers
	
	that directly translate the {Java} source code into the target processor?s
	
	native language; and bytecode-to-source translators that generate
	
	either native code or an intermediate language, such as C, from the
	
	bytecodes. Additional techniques, including bytecode optimization,
	
	dynamic compilation, and executing {Java} programs in parallel, attempt
	
	to improve {Java} run-time performance while maintaining {Java}?s
	
	portability. Another alternative for executing {Java} programs is
	
	a {Java} processor that implements the JVM directly in hardware.
	
	In this survey, we discuss the basic features, and the advantages
	
	and disadvantages, of the various {Java} execution techniques. We
	
	also discuss the various {Java} benchmarks that are being used by
	
	the {Java} community for performance evaluation of the different
	
	techniques. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of the performance
	
	of the alternative {Java} execution techniques based on reported

	The approach is based on an interconnect technology which combines
	
	optical components and a novel architecture design. In DSM systems,
	
	numerous shared memory transactions such as requests, responses and
	
	acknowledgment messages propagate simultaneously in the network.
	
	As the network size increases, network contention results in increasing
	
	the critical remote memory access latency, which significantly penalizes
	
	the performance of DSM systems. In our proposed architecture called
	
	reconfigurable and scalable all-photonic interconnect for distributed-shared
	
	memory (font color=990000>RAPID/b>), we provide high connectivity
	
	by maximizing the channel availability for remote communication to
	
	reduce the critical remote latency. RAPID provides fast and efficient
	
	unicast, multicast and broadcast capabilities using a combination
	
	of aggressively designed wavelength division multiplexing (WDM),
	
	time division multiplexing (TDM), and space division multiplexing
	
	(SDM) techniques. RAPID is wavelength-routed, permitting the same
	
	limited set of wavelength to be reused among all processors. We evaluated
	
	RAPID based on network characteristics, power budget criteria, and
	
	by simulation using synthetic traffic workloads and compared it against
	
	other networks such as electrical ring, torus, mesh, and hypercube
	
	networks. We found that RAPID outperforms all networks and still
	
	provides good performance as the network is scaled to very large

  abstract = {Scalable shared-memory multiprocessors are often slowed down by long-latency
	
	memory accesses. One way to cope with this problem is to use data
	
	forwarding to overlap memory accesses with computation. With data
	
	forwarding, when a processor produces a datum, in addition to updating
	
	its cache, it sends a copy of the datum to the caches of the processors
	
	that the compiler identified as consumers of it. As a result, when
	
	the consumer processors access the datum, they find it in their caches.
	
	This paper addresses two main issues. First, it presents a framework
	
	for a compiler algorithm for forwarding. Second, using address traces,
	
	it evaluates the performance impact of different levels of support
	
	for forwarding. Our simulations of a 32-processor machine show that
	
	an optimistic support for forwarding speeds up five applications
	
	by an average of 50\% for large caches and 30\% for small caches.
	
	For large caches, most sharing read misses are eliminated, while
	
	for small caches, forwarding does not increase the number of conflict
	
	misses significantly. Overall, support for forwarding in shared-memory
	
	multiprocessors promises to deliver good application speedups.},

	of the 1D/2D wavelet transform, that reduces the memory size cost
	
	with one order of magnitude compared to classical implementation
	
	styles. This so-called Local Wavelet Transform also minimizes the
	
	memory access cost, thanks to its spatially localized processing.
	
	Furthermore, the proposed architecture introduces concurrency in
	
	the data transfer mechanism, resulting in speed performances that
	
	are not limited by data transfer delays to/from main (off-chip) memory.
	
	Finally, the production of parent-children trees in indivisible clusters,
	
	makes an easy interfacing to Zero-Tree encoder modules possible,
	
	while keeping Region-of-Interest functionalities. 
	
	
	Practical implementations of the 1D and 2D Local Wavelet Transform
	
	with up to 9/7-tap wavelet filters and a large number of levels (e.g.
	
	4, 5), can process 10 Msamples/s, with an internal processing clock
	
	of 40 MHz, in a very modest 0.7 mu m CMOS process.},

	to find the limits of parallelism for machines that employ different
	
	combinations of these techniques. We have three major results. First,
	
	local regions of code have limited parallelism, and control dependence
	
	analysis is useful in extracting global parallelism from different
	
	parts of a program. Second, a superscalar processor is fundamentally
	
	limited because it cannot execute independent regions of code concurrently.
	
	Higher performance can be obtained with machines, such as multiprocessors
	
	and dataflow machines, that can simultaneously follow multiple flows

  abstract = {To exploit parallelism on shared memory parallel computers (SMPCs),
	
	it is natural to focus on decomposing the computation (mainly by
	
	distributing the iterations of the nested Do-Loops). In contrast,
	
	on distributed memory parallel computers (DMPCs), the decomposition
	
	of computation and the distribution of data must both be handled---in
	
	order to balance the computation load and to minimize the migration
	
	of data. We propose and validate experimentally a method for handling
	
	computations and data synergistically to minimize the overall execution
	
	time on DMPCs. The method is based on a number of novel techniques,
	
	also presented in this article. The core idea is to rank the "importance"
	
	of data arrays in a program and specify some of the dominant. The
	
	intuition is that the dominant arrays are the ones whose migration
	
	would be the most expensive. Using the correspondence between iteration
	
	space mapping vectors and distributed dimensions of the dominant
	
	data array in each nested Do-loop, allows us to design algorithms
	
	for determining data and computation decompositions at the same time.
	
	Based on data distribution, computation decomposition for each nested
	
	Do-loop is determined based on either the "owner computes" rule or
	
	the "owner stores" rule with respect to the dominant data array.
	
	If all temporal dependence relations across iteration partitions
	
	are regular, we use tiling to allow pipelining and the overlapping
	
	of computation and communication. However, in order to use tiling
	
	on DMPCs, we needed to extend the existing techniques for determining
	
	tiling vectors and tile sizes, as they were originally suited for
	
	SMPCs only. The overall method is illustrated on programs for the
	
	2D heat equation, for the Gaussian elimination with pivoting, and
	
	for the 2D fast Fourier transform on a linear processor array and
	
	on a 2D processor grid.},

	and corresponding program fragments. The table is translated to a
	
	program which reads an input stream, copying it to an output stream
	
	and partitioning the input into strings which match the given expressions.
	
	As each such string is recognized the corresponding program fragment
	
	is executed. The recognition of the expressions is performed by a
	
	deterministic finite automaton generated by Lex. The program fragments
	
	written by the user are executed in the order in which the corresponding
	
	regular expressions occur in the input stream. The lexical analysis
	
	programs written with Lex accept ambiguous specifications and choose
	
	the longest match possible at each input point. If necessary, substantial
	
	lookahead is performed on the input, but the input stream will be
	
	backed up to the end of the current partition, so that the user has

	portable Fortran. It is available on the PDP-11 UNIX, Honeywell GCOS,

	implementation of computationally intensive applications due to high
	
	flexibility and parallelism. However, one of the main obstacles to
	
	overcome when trying to accelerate an application on an FPGA is the
	
	bottleneck in off-chip communication, typically to large memories.
	
	Often it is known at compile-time that the same data item is accessed
	
	many times, and as a result can be loaded once from large off-chip
	
	RAM onto scarce on-chip RAM, alleviating this bottleneck. This paper
	
	addresses how to automatically derive an address mapping that reduces
	
	the size of the required on-chip memory for a given memory access
	
	pattern. Experimental results demonstrate that, in practice, our
	
	approach reduces on-chip storage requirements to the minimum, corresponding
	
	to a reduction in on-chip memory size of up to 40? (average 10?)
	
	for some benchmarks compared to a naive approach. At the same time,
	
	no clock period penalty or increase in control logic area compared

	system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable,
	
	transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools
	
	(called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin
	
	follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an
	
	application at the instruction level without the need for detailed
	
	knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed
	
	to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools
	
	source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool
	
	can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation
	
	with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe
	
	the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic
	
	compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For
	
	efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register
	
	re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize
	
	instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly
	
	better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example,
	
	Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for
	
	basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe
	
	two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is

	(32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium, and ARM. In the ten months

	improve software using an {FPGA} but do so using a special compiler,
	
	a {{{{WARP}}}} processor achieves these improvements completely transparently

	detects the binary's critical regions, reimplements those regions
	
	as a custom hardware circuit in the {FPGA}, and replaces the software
	
	region by a call to the new hardware implementation of that region.
	
	While not all benchmarks can be improved using {{{{WARP}}}} processing,
	
	many can, and the improvements are dramatically better than those
	
	achievable by more traditional architecture improvements. The hardest

  abstract = {Understanding the behavior of applications running on high-level language
	
	virtual machines, as is the case in Java, is non-trivial because
	
	of the tight entanglement at the lowest execution level between the
	
	application and the virtual machine. This paper proposes Javana,
	
	a system for building Java program analysis tools. Javana provides
	
	an easy-to-use instrumentation infrastructure that allows for building
	
	customized profiling tools very quickly.Javana runs a dynamic binary
	
	instrumentation tool underneath the virtual machine. The virtual
	
	machine communicates with the instrumentation layer through an event
	
	handling mechanism for building a vertical map that links low-level
	
	native instruction pointers and memory addresses to high-level language
	
	concepts such as objects, methods, threads, lines of code, etc. The
	
	dynamic binary instrumentation tool then intercepts all memory accesses
	
	and instructions executed and provides the Javana end user with high-level
	
	language information for all memory accesses and natively executed
	
	instructions.We demonstrate the power of Javana through a number
	
	of applications: memory address tracing, vertical cache simulation
	
	and object lifetime computation. For each of these applications,
	
	the instrumentation specification requires only a small number of
	
	lines of code. Developing similarly powerful profiling tools within
	
	a virtual machine (as done in current practice) is both time-consuming
	
	and error-prone; in addition, the accuracy of the obtained profiling
	
	results might be questionable as we show in this paper.},

	rewriting, while at the same time ensuring efficient production code.

	range interval methods for plotting f (x, y) = 0 on a rectangular
	
	region based on a subdivision scheme, where f (x, y) is a polynomial.
	
	The solution of this problem has many applications in CAGD. The methods
	
	considered are interval arithmetic methods (using the power basis,
	
	Bernstein basis, Homer form and centred form), an affine arithmetic
	
	method, a Bernstein coefficient method, Taubin's method, Rivlin's
	
	method, Gopalsamy's method, and related methods which also take into
	
	account derivative information. Our experimental results show that
	
	the affine arithmetic method, interval arithmetic using the centred
	
	form, the Bernstein coefficient method, Taubin's method, Rivlin's
	
	method, and their related derivative methods have similar performance,
	
	and generally they are more accurate and efficient than Gopalsamy's
	
	method and interval arithmetic using the power basis, the Bernstein
	
	basis, and Horner form methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

  abstract = {Because modern computer processors are speeding up at a much faste
	
	r rate than main memory, relative latencies from processors to main
	
	memory have dramatically increased. Main memory laten- ties can reach
	
	tens of processor cycles in uniprocessors and over a hundred cycles
	
	in multiprocessors. These figures are likely to grow even larger
	
	over the next decade, and systems architects have responded by adding
	
	one or more levels of cache into memory hierarchies between the processo
	
	r and main memory. Even with these hierarchies, however, many programs
	
	still have poor memory performance if cache misses are common. To
	
	improve program memory performance, programmers and compiler writers
	
	can transform the application so that its memory-referenc- ing behavior
	
	better exploits the memory hierarchy. The challenge in achieving
	
	these program transformations is overcoming the difficulty of statically
	
	analyzing or reasoning about an application s referencing behavior
	
	and interactions. In addition, many performance-monitoring tools
	
	collect high-level information that is inadequately detailed to analyze
	
	specific memory performance bugs. Here we describe MemSpy, a performance
	
	-monitoring tool we designed to help programmers discern where and
	
	why memory bottlenecks occur. MemSpy guides programmers toward program
	
	transformati ons that improve memory performance through detailed
	
	statistics on cache-mis s causes and frequency. Because of the natural
	
	link between data-reference patterns and memory performance, MemSpy
	
	helps programmers comprehend data structure and code segment interactions
	
	by displaying statistics in terms of both the program s data and
	
	code structures, rather than for code structures alone. MemSpy uses
	
	cache simulations to gather detailed memory statistics.},

	two parameters have been considered: number of instructions and processor

	the point of the maximum amount of memory used by the load. Additionally,

	The model computes both temporal and spatial reuse of cache lines

	of compound transformations consisting of loop permutation, loop
	
	fusion, loop distribution, and loop reversal. To validate our optimization

	large collection of scientific programs and kernels. Experiments
	
	illustrate that for kernels our model and algorithm can select and
	
	achieve the best loop structure for a nest. For over 30 complete
	
	applications, we executed the original and transformed versions and
	
	simulated cache hit rates. We collected statistics about the inherent

  abstract = {The semiconductor industry roadmap projects that advances in VLSI
	
	technology will permit more than one billion transistors on a chip
	
	by the year 2010. The MIT Raw microprocessor is a proposed architecture
	
	that strives to exploit these chip-level resources by implementing
	
	thousands of tiles, each comprising a processing element and a small
	
	amount of memory, coupled by a static two-dimensional interconnect.
	
	A compiler partitions fine-grain instruction-level parallelism across
	
	the tiles and statically schedules intertile communication over the
	
	interconnect. Because Raw microprocessors fully expose their internal
	
	hardware structure to the software, they can be viewed as a gigantic
	
	FPGA with coarse-grained tiles in which software orchestrates communication
	
	over static interconnections. One open challenge in Raw architectures
	
	is to determine their optimal grain size and balance. The grain size
	
	is the area of each tile and the balance is the proportion of area
	
	in each tile devoted to memory, processing, communication, and off-chip
	
	global I/O. If the total chip area is fixed, higher processing power
	
	per tile requires large tiles and hence reduces the total number
	
	of tiles on the chip. This paper presents SimpleFit, a novel analytical
	
	framework that designers can use to reason about the design space
	
	of Raw microprocessors. Our model is also generalizable to multiprocessors
	
	on a chip. Based on an architectural model, an application model,
	
	and a VLSI cost analysis, the framework computes the performance
	
	of applications and uses an optimization process to identify designs
	
	that will execute these applications most cost-effectively. Although
	
	the optimal machine configurations obtained vary for different applications,
	
	problem sizes, and budgets, the general trends for various applications
	
	are similar. Accordingly, for the applications studied, assuming
	
	a onr billion logic transistor equivalent area, we recommend building
	
	a Raw chip with approximately 1,000 tiles, 30 words/cycle global
	
	I/O, 20 Kbytes of local memory per tile, three to four words/cycle
	
	local communication bandwidth, and single-issue processors. This
	
	configuration will give performance near the global optimum for most
	
	applications.},

  title = {Scheduling Techniques for Synchronous and Multidimensional Synchronous
	
	Dataflow},
  school = {University of California at Berkeley},
  year = {1996},

  note = {Professor Edward A. Lee, Chair},
  abstract = {In this thesis, we present various scheduling techniques for programs
	
	expressed as Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) and Multidimensional Synchronous
	
	dataflow graphs. Synchronous dataflow has proven efficient as a specification
	
	model for block-diagram based programming environments for signal
	
	processing. Two key reasons for its popularity are that a) static
	
	schedules can be constructed at compile time, thus eliminating the
	
	overhead due to dynamic scheduling, and b) it models multirate signal
	
	processing application very naturally and intuitively. The first
	
	property is particularly important in environments where code-synthesis
	
	for embedded processors is desirable, since embedded signal processing
	
	applications have rigid throughput requirements in order to meet
	
	hardreal- time constraints. Multidimensional Synchronous Dataflow
	
	(MDSDF) is an extension of SDF to multiple dimensions; in this model,
	
	applications such as image and video signal processing, which operate
	
	on multidimensional signal spaces, are more naturally modeled and
	
	specified than in SDF. The amount of on-chip memory available on
	
	embedded processors is often severely limited. Adding off-chip memory
	
	is usually not an option because it entails a speed penalty, it increases
	
	overall system cost and size, and increases power requirements. Thus,
	
	when generating software implementations from SDF specifications
	
	for a uniprocessor, the scheduling problem of minimizing code size
	
	and buffer memory size becomes crucial. If the scheduling is not
	
	done carefully, the blowup in the size of the implementation can
	
	preclude implementation on the processor. Previous techniques have
	
	focused on scheduling to minimize code size. However, this neglected
	
	the buffer memory usage of the schedule; in this thesis, we develop
	
	techniques that jointly minimize for code size and buffer-memory
	
	size of the software implementation. We give three polynomial-time
	
	algorithms: a dynamic programming algorithm that is used as a post-optimization
	
	step, and two heuristics that use different approaches to constructing
	
	these schedules. The general problem is shown to be NP-complete,
	
	thus justifying the use of heuristics. An extensive experimental
	
	study is given to show the efficacy of all these techniques. We extend
	
	these scheduling results to MDSDF specifications. We then tackle
	
	a problem of a different type. A multidimensional signal can be sampled
	
	in many different ways. A straightforward extension of one-dimensional
	
	sampling results in the so-called rectangular sampling structure,
	
	where the samples lie on a rectangular grid. However, a more general
	
	sampling structure is a geometrical lattice; sampling lattices that
	
	are not rectangular can have many advantages in certain applications.
	
	For example, a signal sampled on a non-rectangular lattice can have
	
	a lower sampling density than one sampled on an equivalent rectangular
	
	lattice. For real-time processing of multidimensional signals, a
	
	lower sampling density means fewer samples to process in a given
	
	time interval. The standard MDSDF model suffers from the inability
	
	to model multidimensional systems sampled on arbitrary sampling lattices;
	
	hence, we give an extension of MDSDF that is capable of modeling
	
	such systems. The model we give preserves the property of static,
	
	compile-time schedulability. However, constructing such schedules
	
	requires the solution to some challenging problems. In particular,
	
	we show that an augmented set of balance equations have to be solved
	
	simultaneously in the extended model. The additional equations are
	
	quite different from the usual balance equations in SDF and MDSDF;
	
	they involve computing so-called integer volumes of parallelepipeds.
	
	This computation turns out to be an interesting number-theoretic
	
	problem, and we present several approaches for solving it. Finally,
	
	we present a practical example of a video sampling structure conversion
	
	system to show the usefulness of the generalized MDSDF model.},

  abstract = {Signal flow graphs with dataflow semantics have been used in signal
	
	processing system simulation, algorithm development, and real-time
	
	system design. Dataflow semantics implicitly expose function parallelism
	
	by imposing only a partial ordering constraint on the execution of
	
	functions. One particular form of dataflow called synchronous dataflow
	
	(SDF) has been quite popular in programming environments for digital
	
	signal processing (DSP) since it has strong formal properties and
	
	is ideally suited for expressing multirate DSP algorithms. However,
	
	SDF and other dataflow models use first-in first-out (FIFO) queues
	
	on the communication channels and are thus ideally suited only for
	
	one-dimensional (1-D) signal processing algorithms. While multidimensional
	
	systems can also be expressed by collapsing arrays into 1-D streams,
	
	such modeling is often awkward and can obscure potential data parallelism
	
	that might be present. SDF can be generalized to multiple dimensions;
	
	this model is called multidimensional synchronous dataflow (MDSDF).
	
	This paper presents MDSDF and shows how MDSDF can be efficiently
	
	used to model a variety of multidimensional DSP systems, as well
	
	as other types of systems that are not modeled elegantly in SDF.
	
	However, MDSDF generalizes the FIFO queues used in SDF to arrays
	
	and, thus, is capable only of expressing systems sampled on rectangular
	
	lattices. This paper also presents a generalization of MDSDF that
	
	is capable of handling arbitrary sampling lattices and lattice-changing
	
	operations such as nonrectangular decimation and interpolation. An
	
	example of a practical system is given to show the usefulness of
	
	this model. The key challenge in generalizing the MDSDF model is
	
	preserving static schedulability, which eliminates the overhead associated
	
	with dynamic scheduling, and preserving a model where data parallelism,
	
	as well as functional parallelism, is fully explicit},

  volume = {2},
  pages = {1-145},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Chip multiprocessors - also called multi-core microprocessors or CMPs
	
	for short - are now the only way to build high-performance microprocessors,
	
	for a variety of reasons. Large uniprocessors are no longer scaling
	
	in performance, because it is only possible to extract a limited
	
	amount of parallelism from a typical instruction stream using conventional
	
	superscalar instruction issue techniques. In addition, one cannot
	
	simply ratchet up the clock speed on today's processors, or the power
	
	dissipation will become prohibitive in all but water-cooled systems.
	
	Compounding these problems is the simple fact that with the immense
	
	numbers of transistors available on today's microprocessor chips,
	
	it is too costly to design and debug ever-larger processors every
	
	year or two. 
	
	
	CMPs avoid these problems by filling up a processor die with multiple,
	
	relatively simpler processor cores instead of just one huge core.
	
	The exact size of a CMPs cores can vary from very simple pipelines
	
	to moderately complex superscalar processors, but once a core has
	
	been selected the CMPs performance can easily scale across silicon
	
	process generations simply by stamping down more copies of the hard-to-design,
	
	high-speed processor core in each successive chip generation. In
	
	addition, parallel code execution, obtained by spreading multiple
	
	threads of execution across the various cores, can achieve significantly
	
	higher performance than would be possible using only a single core.
	
	While parallel threads are already common in many useful workloads,
	
	there are still important workloads that are hard to divide into
	
	parallel threads. The low inter-processor communication latency between
	
	the cores in a CMP helps make a much wider range of applications
	
	viable candidates for parallel execution than was possible with conventional,
	
	multi-chip multiprocessors; nevertheless, limited parallelism in
	
	key applications is the main factor limiting acceptance of CMPs in
	
	some types of systems. 
	
	
	After a discussion of the basic pros and cons of CMPs when they are
	
	compared with conventional uniprocessors, this book examines how
	
	CMPs can best be designed to handle two radically different kinds
	
	of workloads that are likely to be used with a CMP: highly parallel,
	
	throughput-sensitive applications at one end of the spectrum, and
	
	less parallel, latency-sensitive applications at the other. Throughput-sensitive
	
	applications, such as server workloads that handle many independent
	
	transactions at once, require careful balancing of all parts of a
	
	CMP that can limit throughput, such as the individual cores, on-chip
	
	cache memory, and off-chip memory interfaces. Several studies and
	
	example systems, such as the Sun Niagara, that examine the necessary
	
	tradeoffs are presented here. In contrast, latency-sensitive applications
	
	many desktop applications fall into this category require a focus
	
	on reducing inter-core communication latency and applying techniques
	
	to help programmers divide their programs into multiple threads as
	
	easily as possible. This book discusses many techniques that can
	
	be used in CMPs to simplify parallel programming, with an emphasis
	
	on research directions proposed at Stanford University. To illustrate
	
	the advantages possible with a CMP using a couple of solid examples,
	
	extra focus is given to thread-level speculation (TLS), a way to
	
	automatically break up nominally sequential applications into parallel
	
	threads on a CMP, and transactional memory. This model can greatly
	
	simplify manual parallel programming by using hardware instead of
	
	conventional software locks to enforce atomic code execution of blocks
	
	of instructions, a technique that makes parallel coding much less
	
	error-prone.},

	a crucial step in architecture exploration. The problem is to minimize
	
	optimization effort and application execution time. Simulated annealing
	
	is a versatile algorithm for hard optimization problems, such as
	
	task distribution on MPSoCs. We propose a new method of automatically

	schedule and transition probabilities for simulated annealing, which
	
	makes the algorithm scalable with respect to application and platform
	
	size. Applications are modeled as static acyclic task graphs which
	
	are mapped to an MPSoC. The parameter selection method is validated

	independence and portability, but because of its slow execution speed
	
	on a software {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM), some people decide to
	
	use faster languages such as C. Building a JVM in hardware is an
	
	obvious solution to this problem. Several approaches have been taken
	
	to try to achieve the best solution. One approach is by reducing
	
	the number of {Java} instructions a program has to execute along
	
	with directly executing instructions in hardware, for example on
	
	a Field Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA}), to increase the execution
	
	speed. Another approach is the translation of {Java} Byte Codes into
	
	native code by a {FPGA} and then executing the native code on a conventional
	
	CPU. Others have developed a multithreaded JVM and exploited the
	
	parallelism offered by a {FPGA} and have specifically designed the
	
	JVM for real-time systems. This paper compares and contrasts all
	
	these approaches and then argues that the parallelism of a {FPGA}
	
	should be exploited in the most general way possible by not restricting
	
	the threads of execution to a specific task. It gives a method for
	
	building such a JVM and also some results from a JVM that was built
	
	using this method. The paper concludes that this approach should
	
	be taken to build a system that is capable of running threads of
	
	a {Java} program in parallel.},

	searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of
	the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions
	of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences.
	The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity
	scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition.
	The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity
	between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using
	the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these
	local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or
	as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized

	The tests evaluated in this study include the generalized greatest

	Benchmarks and the linear algebra libraries, EISPACK and LAPACK.
	
	Two methods were applied, one using only compile-time information
	
	for the analysis, and the second using information gathered during

	all practical purposes as accurate as the more complex Omega test

	trend is towards an increasing embedded software development effort

	alternative mechanism, data forwarding, for reducing memory latency
	
	due to interprocessor communication in cache coherent, shared memory
	
	multiprocessors. Two multiprocessor prefetching algorithms are presented
	
	and compared. A simple blocked vector prefetching algorithm, considerably
	
	less complex than existing software pipelined prefetching algorithms,
	
	is shown to be effective in reducing memory latency and increasing
	
	performance. A Forwarding Write operation is used to evaluate the
	
	effectiveness of forwarding. The use of data forwarding results in
	
	significant performance improvements over data prefetching for codes
	
	exhibiting less spatial locality. Algorithms for data prefetching
	
	and data forwarding are implemented in a parallelizing compiler.
	
	Evaluation of the proposed schemes and algorithms is accomplished
	
	via execution-driven simulation of large, optimized, parallel numerical
	
	application codes with loop-level and vector parallelism. More data,

	for automatically parallelizing computations that manipulate dynamic,
	
	pointer-based data structures. Commutativity analysis views the computation
	
	as composed of operations on objects. It then analyzes the program
	
	at this granularity to discover when operations commute (i.e., generate
	
	the same final result regardless of the order in which they execute).
	
	If all of the operations required to perform a given computation
	
	commute, the compiler can automatically generate parallel code. We
	
	have implemented a prototype compilation system that uses commutativity
	
	analysis as its primary analysis technique. We have used this system
	
	to automatically parallelize three complete scientific computations:
	
	the Barnes-Hut N-body solver, the Water liquid simulation code, and
	
	the String seismic simulation code. This article presents performance
	
	results for the generated parallel code running on the Stanford DASH
	
	machine. These results provide encouraging evidence that commutativity

	at the loosely coupled feature of Chip Multiprocessors, we present

	Furthermore, two aggressive thread construction policies, known as
	
	?Self-Loop? and ?Fork-on-Recursive-Call?, are proposed. ?Self-Loop?
	
	policy can greatly enlarge the prefetching range and issue more timely
	
	prefetches. ?Fork-on-Recursive-Call? policy can eVectively accelerate
	
	applications accessing trees or graphs via recursive calls. For a
	
	set of memory limited benchmarks selected from Olden benchmark, SPEC
	
	CPU2000 as well as Stream benchmark, an average speedup of 3.8% is
	
	achieved on dual-core CMP when constructing basic Dynamic Prefetching
	
	Threads, and this gain grows to 29.6% when adopting our aggressive

  abstract = {With the rise of Chip multiprocessors (CMPs), the amount of parallel
	
	computing power will increase significantly in the near future. However,
	
	most programs are sequential in nature and have not been explicitly
	
	parallelized, so they cannot exploit these parallel resources. Automatic
	
	parallelization of sequential, non-regular codes is very hard, as
	
	illustrated by the lack of solutions after more than 30 years of
	
	research on the topic. The question remains if there is parallelism
	
	in sequential programs that can be detected automatically and if
	
	so, how much parallelism there is. .
	
	
	In this paper, we propose a framework for extracting potential parallelism
	
	from programs. Applying this framework to sequential programs can
	
	teach us how much parallelism is present in a program, but also tells
	
	us what the most appropriate parallel construct for a program is,
	
	e.g. a pipeline, master/slave work distribution, etc. 
	
	
	Our framework is profile-based, implying that it is not safe. It builds
	
	two new graph representations of the profile-data: the interprocedural
	
	data flow graph and the data sharing graph. This graphs show the
	
	data-flow between functions and the data structures facilitating
	
	this data-flow, respectively. We apply our framework on the SPECcpu2000
	
	bzip2 benchmark, achieving a speedup of 3.74 of the compression part
	
	and a global speedup of 2.45 on a quad processor system.},

	Key to performance on this platform is using massive multithreading

	To achieve this, developers face the challenge of striking the right
	
	balance between each thread's resource usage and the number of simultaneously

	performance by reordering accesses to off-chip memory to combine
	
	requests to the same or contiguous memory locations and apply classical
	
	optimizations to reduce the number of executed operations. We apply

	interposer to complete the transmitter and receiver Optochips. The
	
	organic Optocard incorporates 48 parallel multimode optical waveguides

	45$^circ$mirrors in the waveguides. Transmitter and receiver operation
	
	is demonstrated up to 20 and 14 Gb/s per channel, respectively. The

	video compression standards, in particular JPEG2000. A 2D DWT consists
	
	of horizontal filtering along the rows followed by vertical filtering
	
	along the columns. It is well-known that a straightforward implementation
	
	of vertical filtering (assuming a row-major layout) induces many
	
	cache misses, due to lack of spatial locality. This can be avoided
	
	by interchanging the loops. This paper shows, however, that the resulting

	in the Pentium 4 when two data blocks are accessed that are a multiple
	
	of 64K apart, and we propose two techniques to avoid it. In addition,
	
	if the filter length is longer than four, the number of ways of the
	
	L1 data cache of the Pentium 4 is insufficient to avoid cache conflict
	
	misses. Consequently, we propose two methods for reducing conflict
	
	misses. Although experimental results have been collected on the
	
	Pentium 4, the techniques are general and can be applied to other

	environment is targeting a generic RTL processor architecture and
	
	supporting pipelining, multicycling, and chaining. Tasks in the RTL
	
	design process include clock definition, component allocation, scheduling,
	
	binding, and validation. In our interactive environment, the user
	
	can control the design process at every stage, observe the effects
	
	of design decisions, and manually override synthesis decisions at
	
	will. We present a set of experimental results that demonstrate the
	
	benefits of our approach. Our combination of automated tools and

  abstract = {The current practice of mapping computations to custom hardware implementations
	
	requires programmers to assume the role of hardware designers. In
	
	tuning the performance of their hardware implementation, designers
	
	manually apply loop transformations such as loop unrolling. designers
	
	manually apply loop transformations. For example, loop unrolling
	
	is used to expose instruction-level parallelism at the expense of
	
	more hardware resources for concurrent operator evaluation. Because
	
	unrolling also increases the amount of data a computation requires,
	
	too much unrolling can lead to a memory bound implementation where
	
	resources are idle. To negotiate inherent hardware space-time trade-offs,
	
	designers must engage in an iterative refinement cycle, at each step
	
	manually applying transformations and evaluating their impact. This
	
	process is not only error-prone and tedious but also prohibitively
	
	expensive given the large search spaces and with long synthesis times.
	
	This paper describes an automated approach to hardware design space
	
	exploration, through a collaboration between parallelizing compiler
	
	technology and high-level synthesis tools. We present a compiler
	
	algorithm that automatically explores the large design spaces resulting
	
	from the application of several program transformations commonly
	
	used in application-specific hardware designs. Our approach uses
	
	synthesis estimation techniques to quantitatively evaluate alternate
	
	designs for a loop nest computation. We have implemented this design
	
	space exploration algorithm in the context of a compilation and synthesis
	
	system called DEFACTO, and present results of this implementation
	
	on five multimedia kernels. Our algorithm derives an implementation
	
	that closely matches the performance of the fastest design in the
	
	design space, and among implementations with comparable performance,
	
	selects the smallest design. We search on average only 0.3\% of the
	
	design space. This technology thus significantly raises the level
	
	of abstraction for hardware design and explores a design space much
	
	larger than is feasible for a human designer.},

	in a wireless channel. The 3-D set partitioning in hierarchical trees
	
	(SPIHT) coder has proved its efficiency and its real-time capability
	
	in the compression of video. A forward-error-correcting (FEC) channel
	
	(RCPC) code combined with a single automatic-repeat request (ARQ)
	
	proved to be an effective means for protecting the bitstream. There
	
	were two problems with this scheme: (1) the noiseless reverse channel
	
	ARQ may not be feasible in practice and (2) in the absence of channel
	
	coding and ARQ, the decoded sequence was hopelessly corrupted even
	
	for relatively clean channels. We eliminate the need for ARQ by making
	
	the 3-D SPIHT bitstream more robust and resistant to channel errors.
	
	We first break the wavelet transform into a number of spatio-temporal
	
	tree blocks which can be encoded and decoded independently by the
	
	3-D SPIHT algorithm. This procedure brings the added benefit of parallelization
	
	of the compression and decompression algorithms, and enables implementation
	
	of region-based coding. We demonstrate the packetization of the bitstream
	
	and the reorganization of these packets to achieve scalability in
	
	bit rate and/or resolution in addition to robustness. Then we encode
	
	each packet with a channel code. Not only does this protect the integrity
	
	of the packets in most cases, but it also allows detection of packet-decoding
	
	failures, so that only the cleanly recovered packets are reconstructed.
	
	In extensive comparative tests, the reconstructed video is shown
	
	to be superior to that of MPEG-2, with the margin of superiority
	
	growing substantially as the channel becomes noisier. Furthermore,
	
	the parallelization makes possible real-time implementation in hardware

	most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance.
	
	Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput
	
	ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading
	
	and multicore architectures. Both of these features are available
	
	on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current

	devices, with many companies showing new or updated multicore processors.
	
	Looking back, it's not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of

	a network on chip (NoC) needs methods to support application performance
	
	evaluation. Two key aspects these methods have to address are the
	
	generation and evaluation of network traffic. Traffic generation
	
	allows injecting packets in the network according to application
	
	constraint specifications such as transmission rate and end-to-end
	
	latency. Performance evaluation helps in computing latency and throughput
	
	at network channels/interfaces, as well as to identify congestion
	
	and hot-spots. This paper reviews related works in traffic generation
	
	and performance evaluation for mesh topology NoCs, and proposes general
	
	methods for both aspects. Three parameters are used here to define
	
	traffic generation: packet spatial distribution, packet injection
	
	rate and packet size. Two types of methods to evaluate performance
	
	in NoCs are discussed: (i) external evaluation, a common strategy
	
	found in related works, where the network is considered as a black
	
	box and traffic results are obtained only from the external network
	
	interfaces; (ii) internal evaluation, where performance is computed
	
	in each network channel. The paper presents the result of experiments
	
	conducted in an 8x8 mesh network, varying the routing algorithms
	
	and the number of virtual channels. The main contribution of this
	
	work is the set of methods for internal NoC evaluation, which help
	
	designers to optimize the network under different traffic scenarios.},

	is a configurable 2D systolic array of processing elements, which
	
	can provide throughputs over tenths of Giga Operations per Second
	
	(GOPs). The architecture employs a novel-addressing scheme that significantly

	at a low temporal storage cost. A specialized processing element,
	
	called Configurable Window Processor (CWP), was designed to cover
	
	a broad range of window-based image algorithms. The functionality
	
	of the CWPs can be modified through configuration registers according
	
	to a given application. For a current Field Programmable Gate Array

	time for a 7x7 generic window-based image operator on 512x512 gray-level
	
	images is 8.35 ms. The implemented window-based image operators include
	
	generic image convolution, gray-level image morphology and template

	to find parallelism in the program, so it can produce a fast-running
	
	implementation that meets a user-specified cost bound. A number of
	
	program transformations create sections of code with more parallel
	
	computations than the original program has. A novel feature of Flamel
	
	is a method for organizing the search for the transformations that

	height reduction": rewriting an ensemble of expressions using algebraic
	
	properties in order to compute the expressions faster. An implementation
	
	of Flamel has been completed. The output is a description of a datapath

	specification among system components, such as standard-software
	
	and custom-hardware processors. We introduce a new transformation,
	
	called procedure cloning, that significantly improves functional
	
	partitioning results. The transformation creates a clone of a procedure
	
	for sole use by a particular procedure caller, so the clone can be
	
	assigned to the caller's processor, which in turn improves performance
	
	through reduced communication. Heuristics are used to prevent the
	
	exponential size increase that could occur if cloning were done indiscriminately.
	
	We introduce a variety of cloning heuristics, highlight experiments
	
	demonstrating the improvements obtained using cloning, and compare
	
	the various cloning heuristics.},

	bonding technology. The theoretical model was tested by fitting it
	
	to the lasing characteristics obtained for fabricated devices, which

	paid to a tunnel-junction based approach. Bending loss was quantified
	
	to estimate the minimum microdisk diameter. The coupling between
	
	the InP microdisk and Si waveguide was calculated as function of
	
	the bonding layer thickness, waveguide offset and waveguide width.
	
	To study the lateral injection efficiency, an equivalent electrical
	
	network was solved and the voltage-current characteristic was calculated.
	
	Based on these results, the dominant device parameters were identified,
	
	including microdisk thickness and radius, coupling loss and tunnel-junction
	
	p-type doping. These parameters were optimized to obtain maximum
	
	wall-plug efficiency, for output powers in the range 1-100 W. The
	
	results of this optimization illustrate the potential for substantial

	incorporates an arbitrary number of programmable units, exposes the
	
	hardware to the programmers/designers, and allows them to modify
	
	and extend the processor functionality at will. To achieve the previously
	
	stated attributes, we present a new programming paradigm, a new instruction
	
	set architecture, a microcode-based microarchitecture, and a compiler
	
	methodology. The programming paradigm, in contrast with the conventional
	
	programming paradigms, allows general-purpose conventional code and
	
	hardware descriptions to coexist in a program: In our proposal, for
	
	a given instruction set architecture, a onetime instruction set extension
	
	of eight instructions, is sufficient to implement the reconfigurable
	
	functionality of the processor. We propose a microarchitecture based
	
	on reconfigurable hardware emulation to allow high-speed reconfiguration
	
	and execution. To prove the viability of the proposal, we experimented
	
	with the MPEG-2 encoder and decoder and a Xilinx Virtex II Pro {FPGA}.
	
	We have implemented three operations, SAD, DCT, and IDCT. The overall
	
	attainable application speedup for the MPEG-2 encoder and decoder

	are major obstacles to the synthesis of large-scale ASIC systems
	
	in high-level synthesis. This paper presents SOMA, a synthesis framework
	
	for constructing Memory Access Network (MAN) architectures that inherently
	
	enforce memory consistency in the presence of dynamic memory access
	
	dependencies. A fundamental bottleneck in any such network is arbitrating
	
	between concurrent accesses to a shared memory resource. To alleviate
	
	this bottleneck, SOMA uses an application-specific concurrency analysis
	
	technique to predict the dynamic memory parallelism profile of the
	
	application. This is then used to customize the MAN architecture.
	
	Depending on the parallelism profile, the MAN may be optimized for
	
	latency, throughput or both. The optimized MAN is automatically synthesized
	
	into gate-level structural Verilog using a flexible library of network
	
	building blocks. SOMA has been successfully integrated into an automated
	
	C-to-hardware synthesis flow, which generates standard cell circuits
	
	from unrestricted ANSI-C programs. Post-layout experiments demonstrate
	
	that application specific MAN construction significantly improves
	
	power and performance.},

  abstract = {The geometrical model is a powerful tool for program analysis and
	
	optimization and forms the basis on which we build the two parts
	
	of this dissertation, a methodology for incremental loop transformations
	
	and an efficient enumeration technique for parametric integer sets.
	
	Power consumption for typical embedded multi-media applications is
	
	dominated by the storage of and the access to the large multi-dimensional
	
	arrays they manipulate. It is now well known that a design methodology
	
	for reducing power consumption and improving system performance should
	
	apply global loop transformations for increasing locality and regularity
	
	of data accesses. In the first part of this dissertation, we propose
	
	a two-step global loop transformation approach consisting of a linear
	
	transformation focusing mainly on regularity, and a translation focusing
	
	on locality. We further develop a refined regularity criterion and
	
	show how to perform the translation step incrementally, allowing
	
	multiple complicated cost functions to be evaluated. Many compiler
	
	optimization techniques depend on the enumeration of parametric integer
	
	sets defined by linear equations. In the second part of this dissertation,
	
	we present the first implementation of Barvinok's algorithm applied
	
	to the enumeration of parametric polytopes, extending an earlier
	
	implementation of this algorithm for a subclass of the enumeration
	
	problems we consider, and providing a significant improvement over
	
	another implementation based on a different technique. The resulting
	
	enumerator may be obtained as an explicit function or as a generating
	
	function. We further show that these two representations are polynomially
	
	interconvertible and we discuss some approaches for handling generalized
	
	enumeration problems.},

	1 Introduction
	
	
	(# Loop trafos [1], [4], [26])
	
	
	Challenging problems require compound trafos
	
	
	
	Previously used techniques:
	
	
	- Decide order of trafos a priori --> inadequate: desirability of
	
	trafo cannot be evaluated locally, one step at a time
	
	
	- Generate and test: Explore all different possible combinatinos of
	
	trafos
	
	
	- Some combinations of trafos may lead to same behavior
	
	
	- Some trafos come in infinite variations...
	
	
	
	Alternative:
	
	
	(# Loop interchange, reversal, skewing modelled as linear trafos [7],
	
	[8], [12], [13], [19], [21])
	
	
	Polyhedral loop has n - 1 degrees of parallelism [13]###, data locality
	
	in all loop dimensions [24]
	
	
	--> not usable for general loop nests with sequential loops --> commonly
	
	used: direction vectors [2], [26]
	
	
	--> solved here --> easy determination of legality of compound trafo
	
	
	
	Algos to improve parallelism and data locality.
	
	
	Even for simple systems compound trafos for data locality may be necessary
	
	[9, 10, 17].
	
	
	Optimal (compound) trafo without exhaustive search.
	
	
	Implemented in SUIF.
	
	
	
	2 Loop Transformations on Distance Vectors
	
	
	(# Survey of use of DisV-Loop trafos: [20])
	
	
	
	2.A Loop Nest Representation 
	
	
	(# Techniques for extracting DisVs from loops: [12, 16, 22])
	
	
	
	2.B Unimodular transformations
	
	
	Three elementary trafos:
	
	
	- Permutation
	
	
	- Reversal
	
	
	- Skewing --> Lower triangular UM matrix
	
	
	
	UM := { M | ^* M /in Z^(nxn) 
	
	
	^* |M| /in {-1, 1} } 
	
	
	= { Unimodular Matrices }
	
	
	ForAll (a, b): UM^(2) . a * b /in UM
	
	
	ForAll a: UM . a^(-1) /in UM
	
	
	
	Compound trafo matrix: Product of constructing matrices
	
	
	
	2.C Legality of Unimodalr Transformations
	
	
	
	Trafo = legal == Loop nest can be sequentially executed in lexicographical
	
	order
	
	
	
	T2.1: D = { dist vects } --> trafo T = legal == ForAll d : D . Td
	
	>lex 0
	
	
	
	Fully permutable loops: Any permutation allowed
	
	
	
	3 Parallelizing Loops with Distance Vectors
	
	
	n-deep DisV-loops have (n - 1) degrees of parallelism [13]
	
	
	
	3.A Canonical Form: A Fully Permutable Loop Nest
	
	
	DisV-loops always transformable to fully permutable loop nest via
	
	skewing (T3.1)
	
	
	
	3.B Parallelization
	
	
	3.B.1 Finest Granularity of Parallelism 
	
	
	Wavefront trafo
	
	
	- Skew innermost loop with all other loops
	
	
	- Interchange all loops in a cyclic way, making the innermost loop
	
	the outermost loop
	
	
	--> DOALL loops as innermost loops
	
	
	
	3.B.2 Coarsest Granularity of Parallelism
	
	
	Outermost parallel loops possible if DVs do not span iteration space
	
	(in full dimensionality) [14]

	of magnitude slower than the hardware they simulate. Hence, most
	
	microarchitecture design studies draw their conclusions from drastically
	
	truncated benchmark simulations that are often inaccurate and misleading.
	
	We present the sampling microarchitecture simulation (SMARTS) framework
	
	as an approach to enable fast and accurate performance measurements
	
	of full-length benchmarks. SMARTS accelerates simulation by selectively
	
	measuring in detail only an appropriate benchmark subset. SMARTS
	
	prescribes a statistically sound procedure for configuring a systematic
	
	sampling simulation run to achieve a desired quantifiable confidence
	
	in estimates. Analysis of 41 of the 45 possible SPEC2K benchmark/
	
	input combinations show CPI and energy per instruction (EPI) can
	
	be estimated to within 3\% with 99.7\% confidence by measuring fewer
	
	than 50 million instructions per benchmark. In practice, inaccuracy
	
	in micro-architectural state initialization introduces an additional
	
	uncertainty which we empirically bound to /spl sim/2\% for the tested
	
	benchmarks. Our implementation of SMARTS achieves an actual average
	
	error of only 0.64\% on CPI and 0.59\% on EPI for the tested benchmarks,
	
	running with average speedups of 35 and 60 over detailed simulation
	
	of 8-way and 16-way out-of-order processors, respectively.},

	from logic synthesis to the design of discrete controllers. We cast

	the most general solutions under the synchronous and parallel composition
	
	operators. We also specialize such language equations to languages
	
	associated with important classes of automata used for modeling systems,

	as counterparts of FSMs. Thus we can operate algorithmically on those

	closed with respect to various language properties. In particular,
	
	we investigate classes of the largest compositional solutions (defined
	
	by properties exhibited by the composition of the solution and of
	
	the context). We provide the first algorithm to compute the largest
	
	compositionally progressive solution of synchronous equations. This
	
	approach unifies in a seamless frame previously reported techniques.
	
	As an application we solve the classical problem of synthesizing
	
	a converter between a mismatched pair of protocols, using their specifications,
	
	as well as those of the channel and of the required service.},

	simulation focusing on three key issues; reducing size/cost of electrical
	
	to optical (E-O) and optical to electrical (O-E) signal conversion
	
	devices, tolerating alignment accuracy for optical coupling, and
	
	miniaturizing high-speed massive optical switching. S-FOLM, which
	
	consists of film-waveguide-based 3-D structures with embedded optoelectronic
	
	active elements and optical Z-connections for interplane links, enables
	
	drastic size/cost reduction of E-O and O-E conversion devices. 3D-MOSS,
	
	which is an S-FOLM with embedded microoptical switches, has a potentiality
	
	of 1024 /spl times/ 1024 switching with a system size of /spl sim/1.4
	
	/spl times/ 0.6 cm/sup 2/ and an insertion loss of 29 dB. The switching

	be /spl sim/2 /spl times/ 10/sup 5/ 1/s when PLZT waveguide-prism-deflector
	
	microoptical switches are used. By using advanced electrooptic materials,
	
	rates higher than 10/sup 8/ 1/s are expected. Twenty-five percent
	
	misalignment in waveguide assembly raises the insertion loss of the
	
	3D-MOSS to 73 dB. The loss is reduced to 32 dB in SELMOS-based 3D-MOSS,
	
	where a self-organized 3-D microoptical network is implemented using

	the three key issues for board-level reconfigurable optical interconnects.
	
	In addition, photolithographic packaging with selectively occupied

	use this level of indirection to remap their data structures in memory.
	
	As a result, they can control how their data is accessed and cached,
	
	which can improve cache and bus utilization. The Impulse design does
	
	not require any modification to processor, cache, or bus designs
	
	since all the functionality resides at the memory controller. As
	
	a result, Impulse can be adopted in conventional systems without
	
	major system changes. We describe the design of the Impulse architecture
	
	and how an Impulse memory system can be used in a variety of ways
	
	to improve the performance of memory-bound applications. Impulse
	
	can be used to dynamically create superpages cheaply, to dynamically

	gathers and scatters through indirection vectors. Our performance

	for creating superpages using Impulse outperforms previously known

  abstract = {Recent impressive performance improvements in computer architecture
	
	have not led to significant gains in the case of debugging. Software
	
	debugging often relies on inserting run-time software checks. In
	
	many cases, however, it is hard to find the root cause of a bug.
	
	Moreover, program execution typically slows down significantly, often
	
	by 10?100 times. To address this problem, this paper introduces the
	
	intelligent watcher (iWatcher), a novel architectural scheme to monitor
	
	dynamic execution automatically, flexibly, and with minimal overhead.
	
	iWatcher associates program-specified monitoring functions with memory
	
	locations. When any such location is accessed, the monitoring function
	
	is automatically triggered with low overhead. To further reduce overhead
	
	and support rollback, iWatcher can optionally leverage thread-level
	
	peculation (TLS). The iWatcher architecture can be used to detect
	
	various bugs, including buffer overflow, accessing freed locations,
	
	memory leaks, stack-smashing and value-invariant violations. To evaluate
	
	iWatcher, we use seven applications with various real and injected
	
	bugs. Our results show that iWatcher detects many more software bugs
	
	than Valgrind, a well-known open-source bug detector. Moreover, iWatcher
	
	only induces a 0.1?179% execution overhead, which is orders of magnitude
	
	less than Valgrind. Our sensitivity study shows that even with 20%
	
	of the dynamic loads monitored in a program, iWatcher adds only 72?182%
	
	overhead. Finally, TLS is effective at reducing overheads for programs
	
	with substantial monitoring.},

  abstract = {At Leiden Embedded Research Center, we are building a tool chain called
	
	Compaan/Laura that allows us to do fast mapping of applications written
	
	in Matlab onto reconfigurable platforms, such as {FPGA}s, using IP
	
	cores to implement the data-path of the applications. A particular
	
	characteristic of the derived networks is the existence of selfloops.
	
	These selfloops have a large impact on the utilization of IP cores
	
	in the final hardware implementation of a Process Network (PN), especially
	
	if the IP cores are deeply pipelined. In this paper, we present an
	
	exploration methodology that uses feedback provided by the Laura
	
	tool to increase the utilization of IP cores embedded in our PN.
	
	Using this exploration, we go from 60MFlops to 1,7GFlops for the
	
	QR algorithm using the same number of resources except for memory.},

  abstract = {A protocol defines how systems communicate. There are two ways of
	specifying the protocol, the language of communication. One way is
	to specify the automaton that recognizes the language, and this is
	the approach taken by SDL, etc. The other more abstract way ss to
	specify the grammar of the language and let a tool synthesize the
	automaton. Directly specifying the automaton makes the specification
	implementation dependent in two ways: the time behavior is specified
	in terms of states, and the width of the inputs and outputs is fixed.
	By specifying the grammar, the specification is potentially independent
	of both these implementation details and allows design space exploration
	in these dimensions. This paper presents a grammar-based language,
	called Program, that supports a port-size independent specifications
	methodology and its application to parts of the Operation and Maintenance
	protocol, a typical application from the ATM world. The methodology
	has also been applied to another test set of example designs and

	time and cost of design space exploration, since the typical number

	the application of our decomposition methodology in the context of
	PICO. PICO is a design space exploration system that automatically
	generates embedded designs consisting of a stylized processor, hardware
	accelerator and a cache hierarchy, each customized to a benchmark.
	
	First, PICO splits the specified system design space into smaller
	design spaces, one for each of the components, viz. processor, accelerator
	and data/instruction/unified caches. PICO further partitions each
	component design space into predicated design spaces, so that all
	designs in a predicated design space satisfy a specified predicate.
	PICO uses component-level evaluations to identify the performance-cost
	optimal component-level Pareto designs in each predicated design
	space. PICO generates all compositions of Pareto designs from compatible
	predicated design spaces and uses a system-level evaluation to identify
	the Pareto designs at the system level. For reasonable design spaces,
	PICO reduces the design exploration time by over four orders of magnitude

  abstract = {Automated design tools help to capture the benefits of customization
	in embedded system design while not exceeding design budgets. Such
	design tools must understand and exploit the hierarchical structure
	of design spaces, because systems of any significant complexity typically
	consist of components (subsystems). In order to reduce the design
	cost for such systems, designers develop the best component designs

	formed by combining these component designs.
	
	This report formalizes this overall approach. A decomposition splits
	a system design space into smaller design spaces, one for each of
	the components. The validity function determines whether a particular
	composition of component designs is a valid system design. We develop
	efficient ways to filter component designs from further consideration
	with minimal or no effect on the quality of system designs. First,
	we use a component-level validity filter to exclude component designs
	that are not part of any system design. Second, we split each of

	that designs from only certain combinations of these spaces generate

	those arrays which are, typically, accessed inside multilevel loop
	nests and whose index expression includes not only loop iterators

	locality are quite sophisticated in the case of directly indexed
	arrays. But, unfortunately, they are inadequate for handling indirectly
	indexed arrays. In this article we therefore extend the existing
	framework and techniques of directly indexed to indirectly indexed
	arrays. The concepts of reuse subspace, dependence vector, self,
	and group reuse are extended and applied in this new context. Also,
	lately scratch-pad memory has become an attractive alternative to
	data-cache, specially in the embedded multimedia community. This
	is because embedded systems are very sensitive to area and energy
	and the scratch-pad is smaller in area and consumes less energy on
	a per access basis compared to the cache of the same capacity. Several
	techniques have been proposed in the past for the efficient exploitation
	of the scratch-pad for directly indexed arrays. We extend these techniques
	by presenting a method for scratch-pad mapping of indirectly indexed
	arrays. This enables the scratch-pad to be used in a larger context

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that datacenter computers rarely operate
	at full utilization, leading to a number of proposals for creating
	servers that are energy proportional with respect to the computation
	that they are performing.
	
	
	In this paper, we show that as servers themselves become more energy
	proportional, the datacenter network can become a significant fraction
	(up to 50%) of cluster power. In this paper we propose several ways
	to design a high-performance datacenter network whose power consumption
	is more proportional to the amount of traffic it is moving -- that
	is, we propose energy proportional datacenter networks.
	
	
	We first show that a flattened butterfly topology itself is inherently
	more power efficient than the other commonly proposed topology for
	high-performance datacenter networks. We then exploit the characteristics
	of modern plesiochronous links to adjust their power and performance
	envelopes dynamically. Using a network simulator, driven by both
	synthetic workloads and production datacenter traces, we characterize
	and understand design tradeoffs, and demonstrate an 85% reduction
	in power --- which approaches the ideal energy-proportionality of
	the network.
	
	
	Our results also demonstrate two challenges for the designers of future
	network switches: 1) We show that there is a significant power advantage
	to having independent control of each unidirectional channel comprising
	a network link, since many traffic patterns show very asymmetric
	use, and 2) system designers should work to optimize the high-speed
	channel designs to be more energy efficient by choosing optimal data
	rate and equalization technology. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate
	that energy proportional datacenter communication is indeed possible.},

	virtualization. Virtual Machine Monitors for x86, such as VMware
	Workstation and Virtual PC, have instead used binary translation
	of the guest kernel code. However, both Intel and AMD have now introduced
	architectural extensions to support classical virtualization.We compare
	an existing software VMM with a new VMM designed for the emerging
	hardware support. Surprisingly, the hardware VMM often suffers lower
	performance than the pure software VMM. To determine why, we study
	architecture-level events such as page table updates, context switches
	and I/O, and find their costs vastly different among native, software
	VMM and hardware VMM execution.We find that the hardware support
	fails to provide an unambiguous performance advantage for two primary
	reasons: first, it offers no support for MMU virtualization; second,
	it fails to co-exist with existing software techniques for MMU virtualization.
	We look ahead to emerging techniques for addressing this MMU virtualization
	problem in the context of hardware-assisted virtualization.},

	interconnects (e.g. multiplexers) which can heavily influence the

	targeting dynamic reconfigurable circuits. Further, the proposed

	designs. Experimental results on several benchmarks, which have been
	done on our DRL LSI circuit [10], [12], demonstrate that, by jointly

  abstract = {With the rise of multicore computing, the design of on-chip networks
	(or networks on chip) has become an increasingly important component
	of computer architecture. The Cell Broadband Engine's Element Interconnect
	Bus (EIB), with its four data rings and shared command bus for end-to-end
	control, supports twelve nodes--more than most mainstream on-chip
	networks, which makes it an interesting case study. As a first step
	toward understanding the design and performance of on-chip networks
	implemented within the context of a commercial multicore chip, this
	paper analytically evaluates the EIB network using conventional latency
	and throughput characterization methods as well as using a recently
	proposed 5-tuple latency characterization model for on-chip networks.
	These are used to identify the end-to-end control component of the
	EIB (i.e., the shared command bus) as being the main bottleneck to
	achieving minimal, single-cycle latency and maximal 307.2 GB/sec
	raw effective bandwidth provided natively by the EIB. This can be
	exacerbated by poorly designed Cell software, which can have significant
	impact on the utilization of the EIB. The main findings from this
	study are that the end-to-end control of the EIB influenced by software
	running on the Cell has inherent scaling problems and serves as the
	main limiter to overall network performance. Thus, end-to-end effects
	must not be overlooked when designing efficient networks on chip.},

	evaluate the performance of uniprocessor and multiprocessor system
	designs. This paper identifies performance variability as a potentially
	major challenge for architectural simulation studies using these
	workloads. Variability refers to the differences between multiple
	estimates of a workload's performance. Time variability occurs when
	a workload exhibits different characteristics during different phases
	of a single run. Space variability occurs when small variations in
	timing cause runs starting from the same initial condition to follow
	widely different execution paths. Variability is a well-known phenomenon
	in real systems, but is nearly universally ignored in simulation
	experiments. In a central result of this paper we show that variability
	in multi-threaded commercial workloads can lead to incorrect architectural
	conclusions (e.g., 31\% of the time in one experiment). We propose
	a methodology, based on multiple simulations and standard statistical
	techniques, to compensate for variability. Our methodology greatly
	reduces the probability of reaching incorrect conclusions, while
	enabling simulations to finish within reasonable time limits.},

	communication in multi-chip architectures to be arbitrarily adapted,
	leading to efficient parallel signal processing. The use of Opto-VLSI

	is experimentally demonstrated through three scenarios showing its
	flexibility to perform single, multicasting, and parallel reconfigurable

	high-speed reconfigurable N-to-N optical interconnects architecture,

  abstract = {Optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) represent an
	
	emerging technology for use as a communication platform for
	
	systems-on-chip (SoC). It is a novel on-chip communication
	
	system where information is transmitted in the form of light, as
	
	opposed to the conventional electrical network-on-chip (ENoC).
	
	This work studies the performance of a class of ONoCs that
	
	employ a single central passive-type optical router using
	
	wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) as a routing
	
	mechanism. The ONoC performance analysis has been carried
	
	out both at system-level (network latency and throughput) and at
	
	the physical level. In physical-level (optical) performance analysis
	
	of the ONoC, we study the communication reliability of the
	
	ONoC formulated by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the bit
	
	error rate (BER). Optical performance of the ONoC is carried
	
	out based on the system parameters, component characteristics
	
	and technology. The system-level analysis is carried out through
	
	simulation using flit-level-accurate SystemC model. Experimental
	
	results prove the scalability of the ONoC and demonstrate that
	
	the ONoC is able to deliver a comparable bandwidth or even
	
	better (in large network sizes) to the ENoC.},

	to satisfy the dynamism and changing needs of the market. Such scheme
	and specification formalism does not enable to exploit the clear
	commonalities between the different codecs, neither at the level
	of the specification nor at the level of implementation. Such problem
	is one of the main reasons for the typical time gap between the time
	a new idea is validated until it is implemented in consumer products
	as part of a worldwide standard. The analysis of this problem opened
	the door to the rise of a new standard initiative within the ISO/IEC
	MPEG committee called Reconfigurable Video Coding (RVC). The main
	idea is to develop a video coding standard that overcomes many shortcomings
	of the current standardization and specification process by updating
	and progressively incrementing a modular library of components. As
	the name implies, flexibility and reconfigurability are new attractive
	features of the RVC standard. Besides allowing for the definition
	of new codecs, such features open the way to define video coding
	standards expressly targeting implementations on platforms with multiple
	cores. This paper provides an overview of the main objectives of
	the new RVC standard, with an emphasis on features and usage practices
	that fits the implementation on platforms with multiple cores. A
	methodology to efficiently map an RVC codec specification to multi-core
	platforms is also introduced accompanied with two use cases provided
	as examples of the breakthroughs in the design and deployment of
	multimedia services that we expect to appear in the near future.},

	subbands (complete representation). This complete-to-overcomplete
	DWT (CODWT) has certain advantages in comparison to the conventional
	approach that performs the inverse DWT to reconstruct the input signal,
	followed by the a/spl grave/-trous or the lowband shift algorithm.
	Specifically, the computation of the input signal is not required.
	As a result, the minimum number of downsampling operations is performed

	the ODWT subbands by using a set of prediction-filter matrices and
	filtering-and-downsampling operators applied to the DWT. This formulation
	demonstrates a clear separation between the single-rate and multirate
	components of the transform. This can be especially significant when
	the CODWT is used in resource-constrained environments, such as resolution-scalable
	image and video codecs. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed
	transform in these emerging applications, a new scheme for the transform-calculation
	is proposed, and existing coding techniques that benefit from its
	usage are surveyed. The analysis of the proposed CODWT in terms of
	arithmetic complexity and delay reveals significant gains as compared
	with the conventional approach.},

	COTSon is a simulator framework jointly developed by HP Labs and AMD.
	The goal of COTSon is to provide fast and accurate evaluation of
	current and future computing systems, covering the full software
	stack and complete hardware models. It targets cluster-level systems
	composed of hundreds of commodity multicore nodes and their associated
	devices connected through a standard communication network. COTSon
	adopts a functional-directed philosophy, where fast functional emulators
	and timing models cooperate to improve the simulation accuracy at
	a speed sufficient to simulate the full stack of applications, middleware
	and OSs.
	
	
	This paper describes the changes in simulation philosophy we embraced
	in COTSon to address these new challenges. We base functional emulation
	on established, fast and validated tools that support commodity OSs
	and complex multitier applications. Through a robust interface between
	the functional and timing domain, we can leverage other existing
	simulators for individual sub-components, such as disks or networks.
	We abandon the idea of "always-on" cycle-based simulation in favor
	of statistical sampling approaches that can trade accuracy for speed.
	
	
	COTSon opens up a new dimension in the speed/accuracy space, allowing
	simulation of a cluster of nodes several orders of magnitude faster
	with a minimal accuracy loss.},

	high-performance internal crossbar switch. These links provide over
	9 Tbits/second of raw bandwidth and are used to construct a two-level
	direct-connect topology spanning up to tens of thousands of \PS{}
	chips with high bisection bandwidth and low latency. The Blue Waters
	System, which is being constructed at NCSA, is an exemplar large-scale

	Pet scale performance over a wide range of applications. The Hub
	chip supports several high-performance computing protocols (e.g.,
	MPI, RDMA, IP) and also provides a non-coherent system-wide global
	address space. Collective communication operations such as barriers,
	reductions, and multi-cast are supported directly in hardware. Multiple
	routing modes including deterministic as well as hardware-directed
	random routing are also supported. Finally, the Hub module is capable

  title = {The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley},
  institution = {Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University
	of California, Berkeley)},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the
	history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore
	designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary
	compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to
	double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation.
	
	
	A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years
	to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach
	to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor
	systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor
	systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level
	parallelism.
	
	
	We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism
	at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing
	and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel
	landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following:
	
	
	-- The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs
	that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems.
	
	
	-- The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are
	built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS
	(Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon,
	and MIPS per development dollar.
	
	
	-- Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and
	evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf
	is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and
	communication.)
	
	
	-- "Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers
	in translating parallel programs.
	
	
	-- To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models
	must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware
	or applications.
	
	
	-- To be successful, programming models should be independent of the
	number of processors.
	
	
	-- To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support
	a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism:
	task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism.
	
	
	-- Architects should not include features that significantly affect
	performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their
	impact via performance counters and energy counters.
	
	
	-- Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating
	system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual
	machines.
	
	
	-- To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based
	on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable
	and low cost.
	
	
	Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware
	is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system
	software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel.
	Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones
	of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of
	highly parallel systems.},

  abstract = {Integration of optical communication circuits directly into high-performance
	microprocessor chips can enable extremely powerful computer systems.
	A germanium photodetector that can be monolithically integrated with
	silicon transistor technology is viewed as a key element in connecting
	chip components with infrared optical signals. Such a device should
	have the capability to detect very-low-power optical signals at very
	high speed. Although germanium avalanche photodetectors (APD) using
	charge amplification close to avalanche breakdown can achieve high
	gain and thus detect low-power optical signals, they are universally
	considered to suffer from an intolerably high amplification noise
	characteristic of germanium. High gain with low excess noise has
	been demonstrated using a germanium layer only for detection of light
	signals, with amplification taking place in a separate silicon layer.
	However, the relatively thick semiconductor layers that are required
	in such structures limit APD speeds to about 10?GHz, and require
	excessively high bias voltages of around 25?V. Here we show how nanophotonic
	and nanoelectronic engineering aimed at shaping optical and electrical
	fields on the nanometre scale within a germanium amplification layer
	can overcome the otherwise intrinsically poor noise characteristics,
	achieving a dramatic reduction of amplification noise by over 70
	per cent. By generating strongly non-uniform electric fields, the
	region of impact ionization in germanium is reduced to just 30?nm,
	allowing the device to benefit from the noise reduction effects that
	arise at these small distances. Furthermore, the smallness of the
	APDs means that a bias voltage of only 1.5?V is required to achieve
	an avalanche gain of over 10?dB with operational speeds exceeding
	30?GHz. Monolithic integration of such a device into computer chips
	might enable applications beyond computer optical interconnects?in
	telecommunications, secure quantum key distribution, and subthreshold
	ultralow-power transistors.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Disydent, a framework dedicated to system-on-a-chip
	(SoC) platform-based design for shared memory multiple instructions
	multiple data (MIMD) architectures. We define a platform-based design
	problem as a triplet (system, application, constraints) where the
	system is both an operating system (OS) and a hardware (HW) template
	that can be enhanced with dedicated coprocessors. Our contributions
	are: 1) the definition of a complete flow for platform-based design,
	from application to integration including all necessary intermediate
	steps and 2) a set of tightly bound operational tools to implement
	the flow. Disydent is based on four tools. The distributed process
	network (DPN) is a C library for describing Kahn process network
	(KPN)-based applications. The asynchronous serial interface mode
	register 0 (ASIM0) is a multiprocessor target platform running a
	microkernel. This platform can be enhanced with coprocessors generated
	by the user-guided high-level synthesis (UGH) tool. Cycle accurate
	system simulator (CASS) is a high-performance cycle-accurate simulator.
	The main steps of the design flow are KPN modeling, functional validation,
	design space exploration, high-level synthesis, and temporal validation.
	The design flow starts by modeling the application as a KPN. This
	initial description is done in C using the DPN library. The functional
	validation is performed by running the initial description directly
	on the host. Without modifying the initial description, the user
	can simulate a HW/software (SW) partitioning by indicating the number
	of processors and the processes that are to be migrated to HW. This
	simulation is done at the cycle-accurate level for the whole system,
	except for the migrated processes for which the user must provide
	estimated time models. The description of the processes that are
	selected for HW implementation must be translated into a subset of
	C and then synthesized. This new description is still compatible
	with the DPN library, so it can be used for functional validation.
	The temporal validation is done at the cycle-accurate level using
	the initial description for the SW processes and cycle-accurate models
	automatically generated from the C subset description for the HW
	processes. Disydent's strength relies on its formal- KPN model that
	ensures a behavior that is independent of the overall system scheduling,
	its fast cycle-accurate validation that is several orders of magnitude
	faster than classical event-driven simulators, and its single description
	of a process that is used as input of DPN, CASS, and UGH.},

  abstract = {This article presents a technique for the efficient compiler management
	of software-exposed heterogeneous memory. In many lower-end embedded
	chips, often used in microcontrollers and DSP processors, heterogeneous
	memory units such as scratch-pad SRAM, internal DRAM, external DRAM,
	and ROM are visible directly to the software, without automatic management
	by a hardware caching mechanism. Instead, the memory units are mapped
	to different portions of the address space. Caches are avoided due
	to their cost and power consumption, and because they make it difficult
	to guarantee real-time performance. For this important class of embedded
	chips, the allocation of data to different memory units to maximize
	performance is the responsibility of the software.Current practice
	typically leaves it to the programmer to partition the data among
	different memory units. We present a compiler strategy that automatically
	partitions the data among the memory units. We show that this strategy
	is optimal, relative to the profile run, among all static partitions
	for global and stack data. For the first time, our allocation scheme
	for stacks distributes the stack among multiple memory units. For
	global and stack data, the scheme is provably equal to or better
	than any other compiler scheme or set of programmer annotations.
	Results from our benchmarks show a 44.2\% reduction in runtime from
	using our distributed stack strategy vs. using a unified stack, and
	a further 11.8\% reduction in runtime from using a linear optimization
	strategy for allocation vs. a simpler greedy strategy; both in the
	case of the SRAM size being 20\% of the total data size. For some
	programs, less than 5\% of data in SRAM achieves a similar speedup.},

	However, standard techniques such as full just-in-time(JIT) compilation
	and/or adaptive optimization (AO) may not be appropriate for this
	type of systems due to memory and compilation overheads. The research
	presented in this paper proposes a technique that combines some of
	the main benefits of JIT compilation, superoperators( SOs) and profile-guided
	optimization, in order to deliver a lightweight {Java} bytecode compilation
	system, targeted for resource-constrained environments, that achieves
	runtime performance similar to that of state-of-the-art JIT/AO systems,
	while having a minimal impact on runtime memory consumption. The
	key ideas are to use profiler-selected, extended bytecode basic blocks
	as superoperators (new bytecode instructions) and to perform few,
	but very targeted, JIT/AO-like optimizations at compile time only
	on the superoperators? bytecode, as directed by compilation ?hints?
	encoded as annotations. As such, our system achieves competitive
	performance to a JIT/AO system, but with a much lower impact on runtime
	memory consumption. Moreover, it is shown that our proposed system
	can further improve program performance by selectively inlining method
	calls embedded in the chosen superoperators, as directed by runtime
	profiling data and with minimal impact on classfile size. For experimental
	evaluation, we developed three Virtual Machines( VMs) that employ
	the ideas presented above. The customized VMs are first compared
	(w.r.t. runtime performance) to a simple, fast-to-develop VM (baseline)
	and then to a VM that employs JIT/AO. Our best-performing system
	attains speedups ranging from a factor of 1.52 to a factor of 3.07,
	w.r.t. to the baseline VM. When compared to a state-of-the-art JIT/AO
	VM, our proposed system performs better for three of the benchmarks
	and worse by less than a factor of 2 for three others. But our SO-extended
	VM outperforms the JIT/AO system by a factor of 16, on average, w.r.t.

  abstract = {The design and implementation of precise static analyzers for significant
	fragments of imperative languages like C, C++, {Java} and Python
	is a challenging problem. In this paper, we consider a core imperative
	language that has several features found in mainstream languages
	such as those including recursive functions, run-time system and
	user-defined exceptions, and a realistic data and memory model. For
	this language we provide a concrete semantics ---characterizing both
	finite and infinite computations--- and a generic abstract semantics
	that we prove sound with respect to the concrete one. We say the
	abstract semantics is generic since it is designed to be completely
	parametric on the analysis domains: in particular, it provides support
	for \emph{relational} domains (i.e., abstract domains that can capture
	the relationships between different data objects). We also sketch
	how the proposed methodology can be extended to accommodate a larger
	language that includes pointers, compound data objects and non-structured
	control flow mechanisms. The approach, which is based on structured,
	big-step $\mathrm{G}^\infty\mathrm{SOS}$ operational semantics and
	on abstract interpretation, is modular in that the overall static
	analyzer is naturally partitioned into components with clearly identified
	responsibilities and interfaces, something that greatly simplifies

	by allowing for the representation of finite disjunctions of its

	on the base-level domain, the problem of endowing finite powersets
	with a provably correct widening operator is still open. In this
	paper we define three generic widening methodologies for the finite
	powerset abstract domain. The widenings are obtained by lifting any
	widening operator defined on the base-level abstract domain and are
	parametric with respect to the specification of a few additional
	operators that allow all the flexibility required to tune the complexity/precision
	trade-off. As far as we know, this is the first time that the problem
	of deriving non-trivial, provably correct widening operators in a
	domain refinement is tackled successfully. We illustrate the proposed
	techniques by instantiating our widening methodologies on powersets
	of convex polyhedra, a domain for which no non-trivial widening operator
	was previously known.},

	optimization system that is capable of transparently improving the
	performance of a native instruction stream as it executes on the
	processor. The input native instruction stream to Dynamo can be dynamically
	generated (by a JIT for example), or it can come from the execution
	of a statically compiled native binary. This paper evaluates the
	Dynamo system in the latter, more challenging situation, in order
	to emphasize the limits, rather than the potential, of the system.
	Our experiments demonstrate that even statically optimized native
	binaries can be accelerated Dynamo, and often by a significant degree.
	For example, the average performance of -O optimized SpecInt95 benchmark
	binaries created by the HP product C compiler is improved to a level
	comparable to their -O4 optimized version running without Dynamo.
	Dynamo achieves this by focusing its efforts on optimization opportunities
	that tend to manifest only at runtime, and hence opportunities that
	might be difficult for a static compiler to exploit. Dynamo's operation
	is transparent in the sense that it does not depend on any user annotations
	or binary instrumentation, and does not require multiple runs, or
	any special compiler, operating system or hardware support. The Dynamo
	prototype presented here is a realistic implementation running on
	an HP PA-8000 workstation under the HPUX 10.20 operating system.},

  abstract = {Commercial applications such as databases andWeb servers constitute
	the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor
	servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever
	increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated
	memory system design as the critical performance factor for such
	workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized
	to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially
	leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications.
	The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the
	performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available
	applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative
	applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks
	for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.
	
	This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important
	classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP),
	decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the
	Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads,
	and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload.
	This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads
	through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors
	augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of
	architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that
	make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without
	affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that
	systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads
	may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed
	requirements for off-chip caches.},

	is strongly dependent on the sequence of addresses requested. On-chip
	memory buffers can make possible data reuse and request reordering
	which together ensure bandwidth on an SDRAM interface is used efficiently.
	This paper outlines an automated procedure for generating an application-specific
	memory hierarchy which exploits reuse and reordering and quantifies
	the impact this has on memory bandwidth over a range of representative
	benchmarks. Considering a range of parameterized designs, we observe
	up to 50x reduction in the quantity of data fetched from external
	memory. This, combined with reordering of the transactions, allows
	up to 128x reduction in the memory access time of certain memory-intensive
	benchmarks.},

	introduce potential sources of non-deterministic behavior in concurrent

	on the automatic instrumentation of the original source code. Some

	propagates a ``start" and a ``stop execution" signal to its neighbors.
	We show that our control mechanism is much more efficient than existing
	approaches because 1) only two control signals (start/stop) are required,
	2) no extension of the computation space is necessary. 3) By the
	local propagation of just one start/stop signal, energy is saved
	as processing elements are only active between the time they have
	received the start signal and the time they have received the stop
	signal. Our methodology is applicable to one- and multi-dimensional
	processor arrays and is based on local control signal propagation.
	We provide a theoretical analysis of the overhead caused by the control

	the impact of hardware capacity, reconfiguration time, memory organisation,

	Any combination of cache size, cache-line size and degree of sharing

	design. One of the first design decisions is the partitioning
	
	of the system in smaller subsystems, which can be
	
	implemented on separate hardware and/or software components.
	
	Internal communication within components and external
	
	communication between different components can be
	
	distinguished. Especially external communication is cumbersome,
	
	because it determines the requirements for the
	
	communication channels in the system. Distinction between
	
	internal and external communication is defined by the functional
	
	partitioning step which thus has a major impact on
	
	the quality of the final design. By estimating communication
	
	between functions in advance, we enable a better functional
	
	partitioning and therefore improve the communication requirements
	
	in the system. As in [4], {Java} is used in this paper
	
	as a specification language for the system, because this language
	
	is ideally fit for communication analysis. We present a
	
	profiler which measures communication between methods in
	
	{Java}. Our profiler counts the so called consumer-producer
	
	relations for each pair of methods. Each consumer-producer
	
	relation is defined as a pair of a read operation from and
	
	the corresponding write operation to the {Java} heap memory.
	
	The profiling requires a huge increase in execution
	
	time. To reduce this overhead, we implement reservoir sampling
	
	[11]. This sampling method randomly and uniformly
	
	selects a smaller set of read operations to be profiled. The
	
	size of this set, i.e. the reservoir, specifies the sampling accuracy.
	
	Our approach is evaluated on the SPECjvm98 benchmark
	
	suite. The sampling technique reduces the overhead
	
	by a factor of 15. Yet accuracy remains within pre-specified

  abstract = {Due to the huge speed gaps in the memory hierarchy of modern computer
	architectures, it is important that programs maintain a good data
	locality. Improving temporal locality implies reducing the distance
	of data reuses that are far apart. The best existing tools indicate
	locality bottlenecks by highlighting both the source locations generating
	the use and the subsequent cache-missing reuse. Even with this knowledge
	of the bottleneck locations in the source code, it often remains
	hard to find an effective code refactoring that improves temporal
	locality, due to the unclear interaction of function calls and loop
	iterations occurring between use and reuse.
	
	 The contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, the locality
	analysis is enhanced to not only pinpoint the cache bottlenecks,
	but to also suggest code refactorings that may resolve them. The
	refactorings are found by analyzing the dynamic hierarchy of function
	calls and loops on the code path between reuses, called reuse paths.
	Secondly, reservoir sampling of the reuse paths results in a significant
	reduction of the execution time and memory requirements during profiling,
	enabling the analysis of realistic programs.
	
	 An interactive GUI, called SLO (Suggestions for Locality Optimizations),

  abstract = {The growing speed gap between memory and processor makes an efficient
	use of the cache ever more important to reach high performance. One
	of the most important ways to improve cache behavior is to increase
	the data locality. While many cache analysis tools have been developed,
	most of them only indicate the locations in the code where cache
	misses occur. Often, optimizing the program, even after pinpointing
	the cache bottlenecks in the source code, remains hard with these
	tools.In this paper, we present two related tools that not only pinpoint
	the locations of cache misses, but also suggest source code refactorings
	which improve temporal locality and thereby eliminate the majority
	of the cache misses. In both tools, the key to find the appropriate
	refactorings is an analysis of the code executed between a data use
	and the next use of the same data, which we call the Intermediately
	Executed Code (IEC). The first tool, the Reuse Distance VISualizer
	(RDVIS), performs a clustering on the IECs, which reduces the amount
	of work to find required refactorings. The second tool, SLO (short
	for "Suggestions for Locality Optimizations"), suggests a number
	of refactorings by analyzing the call graph and loop structure of
	the IEC. Using these tools, we have pinpointed the most important
	optimizations for a number of SPEC2000 programs, resulting in an
	average speedup of 2.3 on a number of different platforms.},

  abstract = {The implementation of software for embedded digital signal processing
	(DSP) applications is an extremely complex process. The complexity
	arises from escalating functionality in the applications; intense
	time-to-market pressures; and stringent cost, power and speed constraints.
	To help cope with such complexity, DSP system designers have increasingly
	been employing high-level, graphical design environments in which
	system specification is based on hierarchical dataflow graphs. Consequently,
	a significant industry has emerged for the development of data-flow-based
	DSP design environments. Leading products in this industry include
	SPW from Cadence, COSSAP from Synopsys, ADS from Hewlett Packard,
	and DSP Station from Mentor Graphics. This paper reviews a set of
	algorithms for compiling dataflow programs for embedded DSP applications
	into efficient implementations on programmable digital signal processors.
	The algorithms focus primarily on the minimization of code size,
	and the minimization of the memory required for the buffers that
	implement the communication channels in the input dataflow graph.
	These are critical problems because programmable digital signal processors
	have very limited amounts of on-chip memory, and the speed, power,
	and cost penalties for using off-chip memory are often prohibitively
	high for embedded applications. Furthermore, memory demands of applications
	are increasing at a significantly higher rate than the rate of increase
	in on-chip memory capacity offered by improved integrated circuit
	technology.},

	the specification and implementation of digital signal processing
	algorithms. The CSDF paradigm is an extension of synchronous dataflow
	that still allows for static scheduling and, thus, a very efficient
	implementation of an application. In comparison with synchronous
	dataflow, it is more versatile because it also supports algorithms
	with a cyclically changing, but predefined, behavior. Our examples
	show that this capability results in a higher degree of parallelism
	and, hence, a higher throughput, shorter delays, and less buffer
	memory. Moreover, they indicate that CSDF is essential for modelling
	prescheduled components, like application-specific integrated circuits.
	Besides introducing the CSDF paradigm, we also derive necessary and
	sufficient conditions for the schedulability of a CSDF graph. We
	present and compare two methods for checking the liveness of a graph.
	The first one checks the liveness of loops, and the second one constructs
	a single-processor schedule for one iteration of the graph. Once
	the schedulability is tested, a makespan optimal schedule on a multiprocessor
	can be constructed. We also introduce the heuristic scheduling method
	of our graphical rapid prototyping environment (GRAPE)},

  abstract = {A long running program often spends most of its time in nested loops.
	The polyhedral model provides powerful abstractions to optimize loop
	nests with regular accesses for parallel execution. Affine transformations
	in this model capture a complex sequence of execution-reordering
	loop transformations that improve performance by parallelization
	as well as better locality. Although a significant amount of research
	has addressed affine scheduling and partitioning, the problem of
	automatically finding good affine transforms for communication-optimized
	coarse-grained parallelization along with locality optimization for
	the general case of arbitrarily-nested loop sequences remains a challenging
	problem - most frameworks do not treat parallelization and locality
	optimization in an integrated manner, and/or do not optimize across
	a sequence of producer-consumer loops. 
	
	In this paper, we develop an approach to communication minimization
	and locality optimization in tiling of arbitrarily nested loop sequences
	with affine dependences. We address the minimization of inter-tile
	communication volume in the processor space, and minimization of
	reuse distances for local execution at each node. The approach can
	also fuse across a long sequence of loop nests that have a producer/consumer
	relationship. Programs requiring one-dimensional versus multi-dimensional
	time schedules are all handled with the same algorithm. Synchronization-free
	parallelism, permutable loops or pipelined parallelism, and inner
	parallel loops can be detected. Examples are provided that demonstrate
	the power of the framework. The algorithm has been incorporated into
	a tool chain to generate transformations from C/Fortran code in a
	fully automatic fashion.},

	applications and a static platform. Resource management at run-time
	is required to handle future changes in the application set, and
	to provide some degree of fault tolerance, due to imperfect production
	processes and wear of materials. This paper concerns resource allocation
	at run-time, allowing multiple real-time applications to run simultaneously
	on a heterogeneous MPSoC. Low-complexity algorithms are required,
	in order to respond fast enough to unpredictable execution requests.
	We present a decomposition of this problem into four phases. The
	allocation of tasks to specific locations in the platform is the
	main contribution of this work. Experiments on a real platform show
	the feasibility of this approach, with execution times in tens of
	milliseconds for a single allocation attempt.},

  abstract = {{In many applications, subsequent tasks differ only in a specific
	set of parameters. Because of their reconfigurability, FPGAs (field
	programmable gate arrays) can be configured with an optimized configuration
	every time these parameter values change. This results in configurations
	that are smaller and faster than their generic counterparts. Unfortunately,
	the overhead involved in generating these configurations at run-time
	with conventional tools is very large. However, if the incoming tasks
	only differ in a set of parameter values, the use of Tunable LUT
	(TLUT) circuits can drastically reduce this overhead. A TLUT circuit
	is a LUT circuit in which the truth tables of the LUTs are expressed
	as a function of a set of parameters. At run-time the truth tables
	for a specific set of parameter values can rapidly be calculated
	by evaluating these functions. Up to now TLUT circuits had to be
	designed manually resulting in a huge design cost. This paper introduces
	TMAP2, a software tool based on conventional structural mapping that
	automatically generates a TLUT circuit starting from an arbitrary
	Boolean circuit.We have tested TMAP2 on a set of 12 micro-benchmarks
	and we show a substantial reduction in both the circuits area and
	maximum depth compared to conventional implementations.}},

	architectures achieve large degrees of parallelism. However, loop
	unrolling increases the area and can potentially have a negative
	impact on clock cycle time. In most embedded applications, the critical
	parameter is the throughput. Loop unrolling can therefore have contradictory
	effects on the throughput. As a consequence there exists, in general,
	a degree of unrolling that maximizes the throughput per unit area.
	
	This paper studies the effect of loop unrolling on the area, clock
	speed and throughput within the ROCCC, C to VHDL compilation framework.
	Our results indicate that due to the unique design of the ROCCC compilation
	framework, {FPGA} area either shrinks or increases at a very low
	rate for the first few times the loops are unrolled. This reduced
	area causes the clock cycle time to decrease and thus a great gain
	in throughput. Our results also show that there are different optimal
	unrolling factors for different programs.},

  abstract = {The explosive growth of embedded electronics is bringing information
	and control systems of increasing complexity to every aspects of
	our lives. The most challenging designs are safety-critical systems,
	such as transportation systems (e.g., airplanes, cars, and trains),
	industrial plants and health care monitoring. The difficulties reside
	in accommodating constraints both on functionality and implementation.
	The correct behavior must be guaranteed under diverse states of the
	environment and potential failures; implementation has to meet cost,
	size, and power consumption requirements. The design is therefore
	subject to extensive mathematical analysis and simulation. However,
	traditional models of information systems do not interface well to
	the continuous evolving nature of the environment in which these
	devices operate. Thus, in practice, different mathematical representations
	have to be mixed to analyze the overall behavior of the system. Hybrid
	systems are a particular class of mixed models that focus on the
	combination of discrete and continuous subsystems. There is a wealth
	of tools and languages that have been proposed over the years to
	handle hybrid systems. However, each tool makes different assumptions
	on the environment, resulting in somewhat different notions of hybrid
	system. This makes it difficult to share information among tools.
	Thus, the community cannot maximally leverage the substantial amount
	of work that has been directed to this important topic. In this paper,
	we review and compare hybrid system tools by highlighting their differences
	in terms of their underlying semantics, expressive power and mathematical
	mechanisms. We conclude our review with a comparative summary, which
	suggests the need for a unifying approach to hybrid systems design.
	As a step in this direction, we make the case for a semantic-aware
	interchange format, which would enable the use of joint techniques,
	make a formal comparison between different approaches possible, and
	facilitate exporting and importing design representations.},

	is to be linked. More aggressive compilation architectures perform
	cross-file interprocedural or whole-program analyses, potentially
	producing much faster programs but substantially increasing the cost
	of compilation. Even more radical are systems that perform all compilation
	and optimization at run-time: such systems can optimize programs
	based on runtime program and system properties as well as static
	wholeprogram properties. However, run-time compilers (also called
	dynamic compilers or just-in-time compilers) suffer under severe
	constraints on allowable compilation time, since any time spent compiling
	steals from time spent running the program. None of these compilation
	models dominates the others: each has unique strengths and weaknesses
	not present in the other models.
	
	We are developing a new, staged compilation model which strives to
	combine high run-time code quality with low compilation overhead.
	Compilation is organized as a series of stages, with stages corresponding
	to, for example, separate compilation, library linking, program linking,
	and run-time execution. Any given optimization can be performed at
	any of these stages; to reduce compilation time while maintaining
	high effectiveness, an optimization should be performed at the earliest
	stage that provides the necessary program context information to
	carry out the optimization effectively. Moreover, a single optimization
	can itself be spread across multiple stages, with earlier stages
	performing preplanning work that enables the final stage to complete
	the optimization quickly. In this way, we hope to produce highly
	optimized programs, nearly as good as what could be done with a purely
	run-time compiler that had an unconstrained compilation time budget,
	but at a much more practical compile time cost. 
	
	We are building the Whirlwind optimizing compiler as the concrete
	embodiment of this staged compilation model, initially targeting
	object-oriented languages. A key component of Whirlwind is a set
	of techniques for automatically constructing staged compilers from
	traditional unstaged compilers, including aggressive applications
	of specialization and other partial evaluation technology.},

	on- and off-chip. Since optical devices are fundamentally different
	from conventional electronic interconnect technologies, new design
	methodologies and tools are required to exploit the potential performance
	benefits in a manner that accurately incorporates the physically
	different behavior of photonics. We introduce PhoenixSim, a simulation
	environment for modeling computer systems that incorporates silicon
	nanophotonic devices as interconnection building blocks. PhoenixSim
	has been developed as a cross-discipline platform for studying photonic
	interconnects at both the physical-layer level and at the architectural
	and system levels. The broad scope at which modeled systems can be
	analyzed with PhoenixSim provides users with detailed information
	into the physical feasibility of the implementation, as well as the
	network and system performance. Here, we describe details about the
	implementation and methodology of the simulator, and present two
	case studies of silicon nanophotonic-based networks-on-chip.},

	that are scalable and offer a very tight coupling between the processing
	resources. They are therefore quite attractive for use as compute
	servers for multiprogramming and parallel application workloads.
	Process scheduling and memory management, however, remain challenging
	due to the distributed main memory found on such machines. This paper
	examines the effects of OS scheduling and page migration policies
	on the performance of such compute servers. Our experiments are done
	on the Stanford DASH, a distributed-memory cache-coherent multiprocessor.
	We show that for our multiprogramming workloads consisting of sequential
	jobs, the traditional Unix scheduling policy does very poorly. In
	contrast, a policy incorporating cluster and cache affinity along
	with a simple page-migration algorithm offers up to two-fold performance
	improvement. For our workloads consisting of multiple parallel applications,
	we compare space-sharing policies that divide the processors among
	the applications to time-slicing policies such as standard Unix or
	gang scheduling. We show that space-sharing policies can achieve
	better processor utilization due to the operating point effect, but
	time-slicing policies benefit strongly from user-level data distribution.
	Our initial experience with automatic page migration suggests that
	policies based only on TLB miss information can be quite effective,
	and useful for addressing the data distribution problems of space-sharing
	schedulers.},

	incurs many overhead cycles for data alignment. Moreover, this causes

	also contributes to the significant performance improvement by vectorizing

	an auto-vectorization compiler which utilizes these special hardware

  abstract = {The first part of this paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven threshold
	for image denoising via wavelet soft-thresholding. The threshold
	is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet
	coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely
	used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is
	simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because
	it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental
	results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically
	within 5\% of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with
	the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and
	Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part
	of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression
	can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the
	parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising,
	and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically,
	the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous
	to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining
	coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from
	Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments
	show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly,
	especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization
	noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern
	to denoising},

  abstract = {The method of wavelet thresholding for removing noise, or denoising,
	has been researched extensively due to its effectiveness and simplicity.
	Much of the literature has focused on developing the best uniform
	threshold or best basis selection. However, not much has been done
	to make the threshold values adaptive to the spatially changing statistics
	of images. Such adaptivity can improve the wavelet thresholding performance
	because it allows additional local information of the image (such
	as the identification of smooth or edge regions) to be incorporated
	into the algorithm. This work proposes a spatially adaptive wavelet
	thresholding method based on context modeling, a common technique
	used in image compression to adapt the coder to changing image characteristics.
	Each wavelet coefficient is modeled as a random variable of a generalized
	Gaussian distribution with an unknown parameter. Context modeling
	is used to estimate the parameter for each coefficient, which is
	then used to adapt the thresholding strategy. This spatially adaptive
	thresholding is extended to the overcomplete wavelet expansion, which
	yields better results than the orthogonal transform. Experimental
	results show that spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding yields
	significantly superior image quality and lower MSE than the best
	uniform thresholding with the original image assumed known},

	codes that access dense arrays in loop nests, a similar level of
	success has eluded general-purpose pro?grams, especially pointer-chasing
	codes written in languages such as C and C++. We address this problem
	by describing, implementing and evaluating a dynamic prefetching
	scheme. Our technique runs on stock hardware, is completely automatic,
	and works for general-purpose programs, including pointer-chasing
	codes written in weakly-typed languages, such as C and C++. It operates
	in three phases. First, the profiling phase gathers a temporal data
	reference profile from a running program with low-overhead. Next,
	the profiling is turned off and a fast analysis algorithm extracts
	hot data streams, which are data reference sequences that frequently
	repeat in the same order, from the temporal profile. Then, the system
	dynamically injects code at appropriate program points to detect
	and prefetch these hot data streams. Finally, the process enters
	the hibernation phase where no profiling or analysis is performed,
	and the program continues to execute with the added prefetch instructions.
	At the end of the hibernation phase, the program is de-optimized
	to remove the inserted checks and prefetch instructions, and control
	returns to the profiling phase. For long-running programs, this profile,
	analyze and optimize, hibernate, cycle will repeat multiple times.
	Our initial results from applying dynamic prefetching are promising,
	indicating overall execution time improvements of 5.19% for several
	memory-performance-limited SPECint2000 benchmarks running their largest
	(ref) inputs.},

	execution pipeline except a loop counter to keep the two synchronized
	at the boundaries of loop iterations. A detailed simulation study

  abstract = {An I/O bandwidth commensurate with a dramatically increasing on-chip
	computational capability is highly desirable. Achieving this goal
	using board-level copper interconnects in the future will become
	increasingly challenging owing to severe increase in high-frequency,
	skin-effect and dielectric loss, noise due to crosstalk, impedance
	mismatch, and package reflections. The solutions designed to overcome
	these deleterious effects require complex signal processing at the
	interconnect endpoints, which results in a larger power and area
	requirement. Optical interconnects offer a powerful alternative,
	potentially at a lower power. Prior work in comparing the two technologies
	has entailed overly simplified assumptions pertaining to either the
	optical or the electrical system. In this paper,we draw a more realistic
	power comparison with respect to the relevant parameters such as
	bandwidth, interconnect length and bit error rate (BER) by capturing
	the essential complexity in both types of interconnect systems. At
	the same time, we preserve the simplicity by using mostly analytical
	models, verified by SPICE simulations where possible. We also identify
	critical device and system parameters, which have a large effect
	on power dissipation in each type of interconnect, while quantifying
	the severity of their impact. For optical interconnect, these parameters
	are detector and modulator capacitance, responsivity, coupling efficiency
	and modulator type; whereas, in the case of electrical system, the
	critical parameters include receiver sensitivity/offset and impedance
	mismatch. Toward this end, we first present an optimization scheme
	to minimize optical interconnect power and quantify its performance
	as a function of future technology nodes. Next, on the electrical
	interconnect side, we examine the power dissipation of a state-of-the-art
	electrical interconnect, which uses simultaneous bidirectional signaling
	with transmitter equalization and on-chip noise cancellation. Finally,we
	draw extensive comparisons between optical and electrical interconnects.
	As an example, for bandwidth of 6 Gb/s at 100nmtechnology node, lengths
	greater than the critical length of about 43 cm yields lower power
	in optical interconnects. This length becomes lower (making optics
	more favorable) with higher data rates and lower bit error rate requirement.},

	a consequence of a statistically homogeneous circuit topology and

	While wavelet or subband coding of images has been shown to be superior
	to more traditional transform coding techniques, little attention
	has been paid until recently to the important issue of whether both
	the wavelet transforms and the subsequent coding can be implemented
	in low memory without significant loss in performance. We present
	a complete system to perform low memory wavelet image coding. Our
	approach is ?line-based? in that the images are read line by line
	and only the minimum required number of lines is kept in memory.
	There are two main contributions of our work. First, we introduce
	a line-based approach for the implementation of the wavelet transform,
	which yields the same results as a ?normal? implementation, but where,
	unlike prior work, we address memory issues arising from the need
	to synchronize encoder and decoder. Second, we propose a novel context-based
	encoder which requires no global information and stores only a local
	set of wavelet coefficients. This low memory coder achieves performance
	comparable to state of the art coders at a fraction of their memory
	utilization},

  abstract = {We present Offload, a programming model for offloading parts of a
	C++ application to run on accelerator cores in a heterogeneous multicore
	system. Code to be offloaded is enclosed in an offload scope; all
	functions called indirectly from an offload scope are compiled for
	the accelerator cores. Data defined inside/outside an offload scope
	resides in accelerator/host memory respectively, and code to move
	data between memory spaces is generated automatically by the compiler.
	This is achieved by distinguishing between host and accelerator pointers
	at the type level, and compiling multiple versions of functions based
	on pointer parameter configurations using automatic call-graph duplication.
	We discuss solutions to several challenging issues related to call-graph
	duplication, and present an implementation of Offload for the Cell
	BE processor, evaluated using a number of benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Array contraction is an optimization that transforms array variables
	into scalar variables within a loop. While the opposite transformation,
	scalar expansion, is used for enabling parallelism (with a penalty
	in memory size), array contraction is used to save memory by removing
	temporary arrays and to increase locality. Several heuristics have
	already been proposed to perform array contraction through loop fusion
	and/or loop shifting. But until now, the complexity of the problem
	was unknown, and no exact approach was available (and even more,
	only a sufficient condition for array contraction was used). In this
	paper, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the problem. We prove

	precisely one iteration per cycle on each of a prescribed set of

	computation was in vogue, it has defied practical solution until

	reduces the cost of code or hardware whose function is to control
	the flow of data and predicate operations, and to generate memory

  abstract = {We investigate the problem of memory reuse in order to reduce the
	memory needed to store an array variable. We develop techniques that
	can lead to smaller memory requirements in the synthesis of dedicated
	processors or to more effective use by compiled code of software-controlled
	scratchpad memory. Memory reuse is well-understood for allocating
	registers to hold scalar variables. Its extension to arrays has been
	studied recently for multimedia applications, for loop parallelization,
	and for circuit synthesis from recurrence equations. In all such
	studies, the introduction of modulo operations to an otherwise affine
	mapping (of loop or array indices to memory locations) achieves the
	desired reuse. We develop here a new mathematical framework, based
	on critical lattices, that subsumes the previous approaches and provides
	new insight. We first consider the set of indices that conflict,
	those that cannot be mapped to the same memory cell. Next, we construct
	the set of differences of conflicting indices. We establish a correspondence
	between a valid modular mapping and a strictly admissible integer
	lattice?one having no nonzero element in common with the set of conflicting
	index differences. The memory required by an optimal modular mapping
	is equal to the determinant of the corresponding lattice. The memory
	reuse problem is thus reduced to the (still interesting and nontrivial)
	problem of finding a strictly admissible integer lattice of least
	determinant. We then propose and analyze several practical strategies
	for finding strictly admissible integer lattices, either optimal
	or optimal up to a multiplicative factor, and, hence, memory-saving
	modular mappings. We explain and analyze previous approaches in terms
	of our new framework.},

	This decomposition corresponds to a factorization of the polyphase

	That such a factorization is possible is well-known to algebraists
	(and expressed by the formula SL(n;R[z,1/z]) = E(n; R[z,1/z])); it

	provides an alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage
	that it can also be used in the biorthogonal, i.e, non-unitary case.
	Like the lattice factorization, the decomposition presented here
	asymptotically reduces the computational complexity of the transform

	in FPGAs. The main advantage of this new concept is the automated
	tool flow that converts a hardware design into a more resource-efficient
	run-time reconfigurable design without a large design effort. In
	this paper, we show that the automated tool flow for run-time reconfiguration
	can be used to easily optimize a full hardware implementation for
	area by converting it automatically to a hardware/software implementation.
	This tool flow can partition the design in a very short time and,
	at the same time, result in significant area gains. The usage of
	run time reconfiguration allows us to extend the hardware/software
	boundary so more functionality can be moved to software.
	
	We will explain the core principles behind the run-time reconfiguration
	technique using the AES encoder as an example. For the AES encoder
	the manual hardware/software partitioning is clear. This manual partitioning
	will serve as a comparison to the automated partitioning that uses
	parameterisable configurations. Several possible AES encoder implementations
	are compared. Our automatically partitioned AES design shows a 20.6
	% area gain compared to an unoptimized hardware implementation and
	a 5.3 % gain compared to a manually optimized 3rd party hardware
	implementation. In addition, we discuss the results of our technique
	on other applications, where the hardware/software partitioning is
	less clear. Among these, a TripleDES implementation shows a 29.3
	% area gain using our technique. Based on our AES encoder results,
	we derive some guidelines for optimizing the impact of parameterisable

	the design is adapted for use with parameterisable configurations,
	a method for Dynamic Circuit Specialization. Using parameterisable
	configurations allows us to achieve the same area gains as the hand
	crafted reconfigurable design, with the benefit that parameterisable
	configurations can be applied automatically. This results in a design

	for an easier design exploration. Additionally, the parameterisable
	configuration implementation is also generated automatically, which
	greatly reduces the design overhead of using dynamic reconfiguration.
	Secondly, we propose a number of expansions to the original design
	to overcome several limitations in the original design that constrain
	the dynamic reconfigurability of the pattern matcher. We propose

  abstract = {Short-range parallel optical interconnect between integrated circuits
	can alleviate bandwidth, power, and packaging density issues that
	are associated with low-latency high-bandwidth input-output over
	electrical interconnect. In this paper, we evaluate the option of
	using true source-synchronous signaling over optical interconnect
	with a large number of channels, reducing the substantial per-channel
	clock synchronization circuitry to one instance. We also look into
	dc-unbalanced signaling to remove the need for data coding. Uniformity
	across channels is key to the feasibility of such an approach. An
	actual 64-channel parallel optical interconnect setup at 1.25 Gb/s/channel
	is examined, and models for the performance and uniformity of the
	different constituent parts of the interconnect are drawn up. Major
	attention is given to the statistical modeling of the coupling efficiency
	between a vertical cavity surface emitting laser array and a multifiber
	connector. Although derived in the context of a uniformity study,
	the stochastic models and the modeling approach are valuable in their
	own right. In our case study, the usage of a common logic threshold
	across all channels, which is required for dc-unbalanced signaling,
	appears infeasible after all models are combined. Efficient true
	source-synchronous signaling turns out to be within reach in carefully
	designed systems.},

	viable route to relieve the off- and on-chip interconnection bottleneck.
	Low-loss integrated optical waveguides can transport very high-speed
	data signals over longer distances as compared to on-chip electrical
	signaling. In addition, with the development of silicon microrings,
	photonic switches can be integrated to route signals in a data-transparent

	adapted automatically (on a microsecond scale) to the evolving traffic
	situation by use of silicon microrings. To evaluate this system's
	performance, the proposed architecture has been implemented in a
	detailed full-system cycle-accurate simulator which is capable of
	generating realistic workloads and traffic patterns. In addition,
	a model was developed to estimate the power consumption of the full
	interconnection network which was compared with other photonic and

	significantly lowers the average memory access latency (35% reduction)
	while only generating a modest increase in power consumption (20%),
	compared to a conventional concentrated mesh electrical signaling
	approach. When comparing our solution to high-speed circuit-switched
	photonic NoCs, long photonic channel set-up times can be tolerated

  abstract = {Advances in operating systems and languages have brought the ideal
	of reasonably-bounded execution time closer to developers who need
	such assurances for real-time and embedded systems applications.
	Recently, extensions to the {Java} libraries and virtual machine
	have been proposed in an emerging standard, which provides for specification
	of release times, execution costs, and deadlines for a restricted
	class of threads. To use such features, the code executing in the
	thread must never reference storage that could be subject to garbage
	collection. The new standard provides for regionlike, stack-allocated
	areas (scopes) of storage that are ignored by garbage collection
	and deallocated en masse. It now falls to the developer to adapt
	ordinary {Java} code to use the real-time {Java} scoped memory regions.
	Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine manually how to map object
	instantiations to scopes. Moreover, if ordinary {Java} code is modified
	to effect instantiations in scopes, the resulting code is difficult
	to read, maintain, and reuse. Static analysis can yield scopes that
	are correct across all program executions, but such analysis is necessarily
	conservative in nature. If too many objects appear to live forever
	under such analysis, then developers cannot rely on static analysis
	alone to form reasonable scopes. In this paper we present an approach
	for automatically determining appropriate storage scopes for {Java}
	objects, based on dynamic analysis?observed object lifetimes and
	object referencing behavior. While such analysis is perhaps unsafe
	across all program executions, our analysis can be coupled with static
	analysis to bracket object lifetimes, with the truth lying somewhere
	in between. We provide experimental results that show the memory
	regions discovered by our technique.},

	hardware are chosen only when the required performance or energy-efficiency
	cannot be met with a software solution. The performance of a hardware
	design critically depends upon having high levels of parallelism
	and data locality. Often a long sequence of high-level transformations
	is needed to sufficiently increase the locality and parallelism.
	The effect of the transformations is known only after translating
	the high-level code into a specific design at the circuit level.
	When the constraints are not met, hardware designers need to redo
	the high-level loop transformations, and repeat all subsequent translation
	steps, which leads to long design times.
	
	We propose a method to reduce design time through the synergistic
	combination of techniques (a) to quickly pinpoint the loop transformations
	that increase locality; (b) to refactor loops in a polyhedral model
	and check whether a sequence of refactorings is legal; (c) to generate
	efficient structural VHDL from the optimized refactored algorithm.
	
	The implementation of these techniques in a tool suite results in
	a far shorter design time of hours instead of days or weeks. A 2D-inverse
	discrete wavelet transform was taken as a case study. The results

  abstract = {Multimedia applications are examples of a class of algorithms that
	are both calculation and data intensive and have real-time requirements.
	As a result dedicated hardware acceleration is often needed. Usually
	the on-chip memory is not sufficient to store all data and has to
	be extended with external memory. The bandwidth to this memory often
	becomes a bottle neck. Loop transformations are needed to reduce
	this bandwidth, by improving the temporal and spatial data locality.
	They can also unveil the parallelism present in the algorithm. The
	polyhedral model offers a flexible program representation that allows
	to automate this kind of transformations. The class of applications
	that can be transformed with the polyhedral model fits very well
	into the class of applications that can benefit from hardware acceleration.
	This paper describes how the existing tools, that generate software
	from a polyhedral program representation, have been extended to generate
	a VHDL description of a hardware controller. The corresponding data
	path is generated semi-automatically. Combining the generation of
	controller and data path creates a fast path to hardware. Our techniques
	enable an easy exploration of the design space, by generating a lot
	of implementation variants. The techniques are demonstrated on an
	inverse discrete wavelet transform resulting in several synthesizable
	designs, of which one has been hand-optimized towards a {FPGA} implementation.
	The results outperform those of a commercial C-to-VHDL compiler.
	The generated variants run 5 to 10 times faster while consuming less

	computer systems. An effective strategy is to group computations
	on the same data so that once the data are loaded into cache, the
	program performs all their operations before the data are evicted.
	However, computation regrouping is difficult to automate for programs
	with complex data and control structures. This paper studies the
	potential of locality improvement through trace-driven computation
	regrouping. First, it shows that maximizing the locality is different
	from maximizing the parallelism or maximizing the cache utilization.
	The problem is NP-hard even without considering data dependences
	and cache organization. Then the paper describes a tool that performs
	constrained computation regrouping on program traces. The new tool
	is unique because it measures the exact control dependences and applies
	complete memory renaming and re-allocation. Using the tool, the paper

	for inputs other than profiled ones. Here locality is defined by
	the distance of data reuse. Studying whole-program data reuse may
	reveal global patterns not apparent in short-distance reuses or local
	control flow. However, the analysis must meet two requirements to
	be useful. The first is efficiency. It needs to analyze all accesses
	to all data elements in full-size benchmarks and to measure distance
	of any length and in any required precision. The second is predication.
	Based on a few training runs, it needs to classify patterns as regular
	and irregular and, for regular ones, it should predict their (changing)
	behavior for other inputs. In this paper, we show that these goals
	are attainable through three techniques: approximate analysis of
	reuse distance (originally called LRU stack distance), pattern recognition,
	and distance-based sampling. When tested on 15 integer and floating-point
	programs from SPEC and other benchmark suites, our techniques predict
	with on average 94% accuracy for data inputs up to hundreds times
	larger than the training inputs. Based on these results, the paper
	discusses possible uses of this analysis.},

	The high level synthesis for dedicated coprocessor is a very complex
	problem. It has to cope with different aims like the working frequency,
	the surface, the consumption, etc... These criteria specify the generated
	circuit and the high level synthesis tool efficiency. This Ph.D thesis
	presents a two steps approach in the high level synthesis. In the
	first step, we minimize the surface and maximize the parallelism.
	In the second step, the circuit is modified to take in account the
	electrical characteristics and to fetch the wanted working frequency.
	The synthesis tool has to optimize the circuit on a very few number
	of criteria which are specified by the designer. By the way, for
	the data control dominated circuits, the aim can't be qualified by
	a global guidance, because a such guidance is unadapted and can't
	qualify the optimization level. The collateral effects on the other
	characteristics of the circuit aren't controlled by the designer.
	The respect of the global guidance is difficult to reach by the synthesis
	algorithms. The scheduling, allocation and binding phases of the
	high level synthesis are NP-complex. Most of these problems are solved
	with heuristics which have unpredictable consequences on the circuit
	characteristics. The automation of the high level synthesis needs
	a very precise description of the designer's attempts. We are studying
	in this Ph.D thesis the necessary guidances to precisely aim a solution
	and keep the compatibility with our two-phases approach. We have
	to reduce the guidance definition to facilitate the designer's work
	and be aware of the loss of efficiency which has been induced.},

	structure for small sets of homologous RNAs, by incorporating limited

	algorithm for simultaneous RNA folding and alignment is a basis for
	approaches to this problem. There are two open problems in applying
	a Sankoff algorithm: development of a good unified scoring system
	for alignment and folding and development of practical heuristics
	for dealing with the computational complexity of the algorithm.RESULTS:We
	use probabilistic models (pair stochastic context-free grammars,
	pairSCFGs) as a unifying framework for scoring pairwise alignment
	and folding. A constrained version of the pairSCFG structural alignment
	algorithm was developed which assumes knowledge of a few confidently
	aligned positions (pins). These pins are selected based on the posterior
	probabilities of a probabilistic pairwise sequence alignment.CONCLUSION:Pairwise
	RNA structural alignment improves on structure prediction accuracy
	relative to single sequence folding. Constraining on alignment is
	a straightforward method of reducing the runtime and memory requirements
	of the algorithm. Five practical implementations of the pairwise
	Sankoff algorithm - this work (Consan), David Mathews' Dynalign,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Covariance models (CMs) are probabilistic models of RNA
	secondary structure, analogous to profile hidden Markov models of
	linear sequence. The dynamic programming algorithm for aligning a
	CM to an RNA sequence of length N is O(N3) in memory. This is only
	practical for small RNAs.RESULTS:I describe a divide and conquer
	variant of the alignment algorithm that is analogous to memory-efficient
	Myers/Miller dynamic programming algorithms for linear sequence alignment.
	The new algorithm has an O(N2 log N) memory complexity, at the expense
	of a small constant factor in time.CONCLUSIONS:Optimal ribosomal
	RNA structural alignments that previously required up to 150 GB of
	memory now require less than 270 MB.},

	surfaces are usually tessellated, in the software application, into
	triangle models to be rendered. Then, the final image is generated
	in the graphics card so that its triangle rendering capabilities
	are exploited. In this work we present an adaptive tessellation algorithm
	and the corresponding architecture to be implemented in hardware.
	The objective of the proposal is to avoid the potential bottleneck
	associated with the transmission of complex triangular models from
	CPU to graphics cards. The algorithm we propose is based on a layer
	strip representation method and a new data management that permits
	generation and efficient storage of the tessellated mesh. The corresponding
	architecture has to be included as an additional unit at the input
	of the graphics card. As a consequence, the transmission requirements
	from CPU to graphics card are greatly reduced as the tessellation
	is performed in the graphics card. On the other hand, the adaptive
	strategy employed permits selection of the number of triangles of
	the final mesh as a trade off between computational requirements
	and quality of the final mesh. The efficient data management proposed,
	together with the low storage requirements of the architecture, makes
	it a good candidate for its hardware implementation and inclusion
	in future graphics cards.},

  abstract = {Code instrumentation is widely used for a range of purposes that include
	profiling, debugging, visualization, logging, and distributed computing.
	Due to their special status within the language infrastructure, the
	<i>standard class libraries</i>, also known as <i>system classes</i>
	provided by most contemporary object-oriented languages are difficult
	and sometimes impossible to instrument. If instrumented, the use
	of their rewritten versions within the instrumentation code is usually
	unavoidable. However, this is equivalent to `instrumenting the instrumentation',
	and thus may lead to erroneous results. Consequently, most systems
	avoid rewriting system classes. We present a novel instrumentation
	strategy that alleviates the above problems by renaming the instrumented
	classes. The proposed approach does not require any modifications
	to the language, compiler or runtime. It allows system classes to
	be instrumented both statically and dynamically. In fact, this is
	the first technique that enables dynamic instrumentation of {Java}
	system classes without modification of any runtime components. We
	demonstrate our approach by implementing two instrumentation-based
	systems: a memory profiler and a distributed runtime for {Java}.},

  abstract = {Scheduling a program (i.e. constructing a timetable for the execution
	of its operations) is one of the most powerful methods for automatic
	parallelization. A schedule gives a blueprint for constructing a
	synchronous program, suitable for an ASIC or a VLIW processor. However,
	constructing a schedule entails solving a large linear program. Even
	if one accepts the (experimental) fact that the Simplex is almost
	always polynomial, the scheduling time is of the order of a large
	power of the program size and of the maximum nesting level of its
	loops. Hence the method is not scalable. The present paper presents
	two methods for improving this situation. Firstly, a big program
	can be divided into smaller units (processes) which can be scheduled
	separately. This is modular scheduling. Second, one can use projection
	methods for solving linear programming problems incrementally. This
	is especially efficient if the dependence graph is sparse.},

	In Very Long Instruction Word machines, many statically scheduled,
	tightly coupled, fine-grained operations execute in parallel within
	a single instruction stream. VLIWs are more parallel extensions of
	several current architectures. These current architectures have never
	cracked a fundamental barrier. The speedup they get from parallelism
	is never more than a factor of 2 to 3. Not that we couldn't build
	more parallel machines of this type; but until trace scheduling we
	didn't know how to generate code for them. Trace scheduling finds
	sufficient parallelism in ordinary code to justify thinking about
	a highly parallel VLIW. At Yale we are actually building one. Our

  abstract = {We perform a thorough data dependence and localization analysis for
	the discrete wavelet transform algorithm and then use it to synthesize
	distributed memory and control architectures for its parallel computation.
	The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is characterized by a nonuniform
	data dependence structure owing to the decimation operation it is
	neither a uniform recurrence equation (URE) nor an affine recurrence
	equation (ARE) and consequently cannot be transformed directly using
	linear space-time mapping methods into efficient array architectures.
	Our approach is to apply first appropriate nonlinear transformations
	operating on the algorithm's index space, leading to a new DWT formulation
	on which application of linear space-time mapping can become effective.
	The first transformation of the algorithm achieves regularization
	of interoctave dependencies but alone does not lead to efficient
	array solutions after the mapping due to limitations associated with
	transforming the three-dimensional (3-D) algorithm onto one-dimensional
	(1-D) arrays, which is also known as multiprojection. The second
	transformation is introduced to remove the need for multiprojection
	by formulating the regularized DWT algorithm in a two-dimensional
	(2-D) index space. Using this DWT formulation, we have synthesized
	two VLSI-amenable linear arrays of LPEs computing a 6-octave DWT
	decomposition with latencies of M and 2M-1, respectively, where L
	is the wavelet filter length, and M is the number of samples in the
	data sequence. The arrays are modular, regular, use simple control,
	and can be easily extended to larger L and J. The latency of both
	arrays is independent of the highest octave J, and the efficiency
	is nearly 100\% for any M with one design achieving the lowest possible
	latency of M},

	Compared with traditional graph-coloring approaches, the IP-based
	allocators can improve a program's performance. However the solution
	times are much slower This paper presents an IP-based optimal register
	allocator which is much faster than previous work. We present several
	local and global reduction techniques to identify locations in a
	program's control-flow graph where spill decisions and register deallocation
	decisions are unnecessary for optimal register allocation. We propose
	a hierarchical reduction approach to efficiently remove the corresponding
	redundant decisions and constraints from the IP model. This allocator
	is built into the Gnu C Compiler and is evaluated experimentally
	using the SPEC92INT benchmarks. The results show that the improved
	IP model is much simpler The number of constraints produced is almost
	linear with the function size. The optimal allocation time is much
	faster with a speedup factor of about 150 for hard allocation problems.},

	because it is not based on tables. At the same time, the strategy
	is easy to reconfigure, being able to implement the most commonly

	functionality at minimal battery exhaustion. This type of application
	imposes heavy constraints for both performance and energy consumption,
	which can be met using a parallel implementation. An efficient parallelization
	should pay attention to the memory subsystem, which can become a
	severe bottleneck in a multiprocessor environment. In this paper
	we present a mapping of the Wavelet Transform to ADI's dual-core
	Blackfin 561. We do a coarse data-level split of a previous implementation
	on a single-core Blackfin 533 with cache. Unfortunately, doing so
	we observe only a marginal speed-up due to memory access inefficiencies.
	This problem is addressed in three steps: first we replace local
	caches by a software-controlled scratchpad memory filled using DMA
	transfers. Next we let one core schedule these transfers for both
	cores. Finally we modify the transfers to avoid page misses to SDRAM.
	All these steps result in a x1.86 speed-up against a single-core
	version, or equivalently a 40\% power saving at the same performance,
	showing how efficient data-level parallelization on a multi-core
	DSP is possible when attention is paid to memory subsystem needs.},

  abstract = {{Java} performance is far from being trivial to benchmark because
	it is affected by various factors such as the {Java} application,
	its input, the virtual machine, the garbage collector, the heap size,
	etc. In addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the execution
	time of a {Java} program to differ from run to run.There are a number
	of sources of non-determinism such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
	and optimization in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timer-based
	method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection, and various
	system effects. There exist a wide variety of {Java} performance
	evaluation methodologies used by researchers and benchmarkers. These
	methodologies differ from each other in a number of ways. Some report
	average performance over a number of runs of the same experiment;
	others report the best or second best performance observed; yet others
	report the worst. Some iterate the benchmark multiple times within
	a single VM invocation; others consider multiple VM invocations and
	iterate a single benchmark execution; yet others consider multiple
	VM invocations and iterate the benchmark multiple times. This paper
	shows that prevalent methodologies can be misleading, and can even
	lead to incorrect conclusions. The reason is that the data analysis
	is not statistically rigorous. In this paper, we present a survey
	of existing {Java} performance evaluation methodologies and discuss
	the importance of statistically rigorous data analysis for dealing
	with non-determinism. We advocate approaches to quantify startup
	as well as steady-state performance, and, in addition, we provide
	the {Java}Stats software to automatically obtain performance numbers
	in a rigorous manner. Although this paper focuses on {Java} performance
	evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this paper also apply
	to other programming languages and systems that build on a managed
	runtime system.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, real-time embedded systems have become much more
	complex due to the introduction of a lot of new functionality in
	one application, and due to running multiple applications concurrently.
	This increases the dynamic nature of today's applications and systems,
	and tightens the requirements for their constraints in terms of deadlines
	and energy consumption. State-of-the-art design methodologies try
	to cope with these novel issues by identifying several most used
	cases and dealing with them separately, reducing the newly introduced
	complexity. This article presents a generic and systematic design-time/run-time
	methodology for handling the dynamic nature of modern embedded systems,
	which can be utilized by existing design methodologies to increase
	their efficiency. It is based on the concept of system scenarios,
	which group system behaviors that are similar from a multidimensional
	cost perspective?such as resource requirements, delay, and energy
	consumption?in such a way that the system can be configured to
	exploit this cost similarity. At design-time, these scenarios are
	individually optimized. Mechanisms for predicting the current scenario
	at run-time, and for switching between scenarios, are also derived.
	This design trajectory is augmented with a run-time calibration mechanism,
	which allows the system to learn on-the-fly during its execution,
	and to adapt itself to the current input stimuli, by extending the
	scenario set, changing the scenario definitions, and both the prediction
	and switching mechanisms. To show the generality of our methodology,
	we show how it has been applied on four very different real-life
	design problems. In all presented case studies, substantial energy
	reductions were obtained by exploiting scenarios.},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {This thesis extends techniques from digital circuit interconnect prediction
	(in particular
	
	Rent?s rule) to analyse and predict interconnectedness in software,
	Chip-Multiprocessors
	
	(CMP) and Networks-on-Chip (NoC). Since the birth of the microprocessor,
	transistors
	
	have been getting cheaper, faster and more energy efficient, whereas
	global wires
	
	have changed little. At the same time we are moving towards thousands
	of processing
	
	cores on a chip, with software distributed across them. This new era
	of communicationdominated
	
	computing is marked by local computation on a core being cheap, but
	with
	
	global communication between cores and with external memory as expensive.
	Thus the
	
	physical spatial position of software starts to become important.
	Indeed, it is shown that
	
	unless physical locality in communication is exploited, the costs
	become untenable with
	
	technology scaling.
	
	In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuits, the fractal connectivity
	of Rent?s rule is
	
	a well known predictor of the physical locality of interconnect across
	many orders of
	
	magnitude. It is shown how a generalised Rent?s rule can characterise
	and model both
	
	spatial and temporal locality in software, and it is demonstrated
	that locality effects
	
	can be exploited in Network-on-Chip design for fault tolerance. Evidence
	of Rentian
	
	fractal scaling in software is examined across several benchmarks
	using multiple methods.
	
	Given Rentian scaling, many fundamental results are derived for future
	many-core
	
	CMP architectures that relate number of cores, communication, on-chip
	memory and
	
	the Rent?s exponent, including some surprising scaling requirements
	towards fine-grain
	
	communication. It is also shown that existing models of an algorithm?s
	asymptotic time
	
	and energy cost are inadequate to account for physical communication
	costs and locality.
	
	A new analytical framework that utilises locality and its Rentian
	characterisation
	
	is demonstrated on several example algorithms, and a study is made
	of the ?embedding
	
	problem? for composing embeddings of algorithms together. Finally,
	in examining the
	
	interplay of communication and massively parallel computation at larger
	scales, we look
	
	at the mammalian brain as a proof-of-existence. We show that Rent?s
	rule also appears
	
	to apply to neuronal systems, and that this relates to the allometric
	scaling of communication
	
	to computation.},

  abstract = {Various powerful polyhedral techniques exist to optimize computation
	intensive programs effectively. Applying these techniques on any
	non-trivial program is still surprisingly difficult and often not
	as effective as expected. Most polyhedral tools are limited to a
	specific programming language. Even for this language, relevant code
	needs to match specific syntax that rarely appears in existing code.
	It is therefore hard or even impossible to process existing programs
	automatically. In addition, most tools target C or OpenCL code, which
	prevents effective communication with compiler internal optimizers.
	As a result target architecture specific optimizations are either
	little effective or not approached at all.
	
	
	In this paper we present Polly, a project to enable polyhedral optimizations
	in LLVM. Polly automatically detects and transforms relevant program
	parts in a language-independent and syntactically transparent way.
	Therefore, it supports programs written in most common programming
	languages and constructs like C++ iterators, goto based loops and
	pointer arithmetic. Internally it provides a state-of-the-art polyhedral
	library with full support for Z-polyhedra, advanced data dependency
	analysis and support for external optimizers. Polly includes integrated
	SIMD and OpenMP code generation. Through LLVM, machine code for CPUs
	and GPU accelerators, C source code and even hardware descriptions
	can be targeted},

  abstract = {Sustained growth in high performance computing and the availability
	of advanced mobile devices increase the use of computation intensive
	applications. To ensure fast execution and consequently low power
	usage modern hardware provides multi-level caches, multiple cores,
	SIMD instructions or even dedicated vector accelerators. Taking advantage
	of those manually is difficult and often not possible in a portable
	way. Fortunately, advanced techniques that increase data-locality
	and parallelism with the help of polyhedral abstractions are known
	to be effective in exploiting hardware capabilities. Yet, their automatic
	use is currently limited. They are mostly implemented in language
	specific source-to-source compilers which can only optimize manually
	annotated code that matches a certain canonical structure. Furthermore,
	polyhedral optimizers often target C or CUDA code, which limits efficient
	communication with compiler internals and can lead to missed optimization
	opportunities.
	
	In this thesis we present Polly, a project to enable polyhedral optimizations
	in LLVM. LLVM is an infrastructure project used in compilers for
	a large set of different programming languages. It is built around
	a low-level intermediate representation (LLVM-IR) that allows language
	independent optimizations. We present how Polly can apply polyhedral
	transformations on this representation. This includes the detection
	of static control parts, their translation into a Z-polyhedra based
	representation, optimizations on this representation and finally,
	the generation of optimized LLVM-IR. We also define an interface
	to connect external optimizers and show a novel approach to detect
	parallelism which is used to generate SIMD and OpenMP code. Finally,
	we show in some experiments how Polly can be used to automatically
	apply optimizations for data locality and parallelism.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces methods for extending the classical systolic
	synthesis methodology to multidimensional time. Multi-dimensional
	scheduling enables complex algorithms that do not admit linear schedules
	to be parallelized, but it requires the use of memories in the architecture.
	The synthesis of such an architecture requires the definition of
	an allocation function that maps the calculations on the processors,
	and memory functions that define where the data are stored during
	execution. As our approach targets custom VLSI architectures, we
	constrain the synthesis method to produce parallel architectures
	that that satisfy the computer owns rule, i.e., each processor computes
	the data which are stored in its local memory. We explain how to
	combine the allocation and memory functions in order to meet the
	computer owns rule, and we present an original mechanism for controlling
	the operation of the architecture. We detail the different steps
	needed to generate a HDL description of the architecture, and we
	illustrate our method on the matrix multiplication algorithm. We
	describe a structural VHDL program that has been derived and synthesized
	for a {FPGA} platform using these design principles. Our results
	show that the complexity added in each processor by the memories
	and the control is moderate and justifies in practice the use of
	such architectures.},

	a compile-time approach to reuse data in window-based codes. The

	in C. It then computes the size of the hardware buffer and defines
	three sets of data values for each window: the window set, the managed

	that can be exploited on the {FPGA} is a big component. By itself,
	however, it does not account for the whole speedup.In this paper
	we experimentally analyze the remaining components of the speedup.
	We compare the performance of image processing application programs
	executing in hardware on a Xilinx Virtex E2000 {FPGA} to that on
	three general-purpose processor platforms: MIPS, Pentium III and
	VLIW. The question we set out to answer is what is the inherent advantage
	of a hardware implementation over a von Neumann platform. On the
	one hand, the clock frequency of general-purpose processors is about
	20 times that of typical {FPGA} implementations. On the other hand,
	the iteration level parallelism on the {FPGA} is one to two orders
	of magnitude that on the CPUs. In addition to these two factors,
	we identify the efficiency advantage of {FPGA}s as an important factor
	and show that it ranges from 6 to 47 on our test benchmarks. We also
	identify some of the components of this factor: the streaming of
	data from memory, the overlap of control and data flow and the elimination
	of some instruction on the {FPGA}. The results provide a deeper understanding
	of the tradeoff between system complexity and performance when designing
	Configurable SoC as well as designing software for CSoC. They also

  school = {Stanford University},
  year = {1993},
  month = {December 10},
  abstract = {As the complexity of systems being subject to computer-aided synthesis
	and optimization techniques increases, so does the need to find ways
	to incorporate predesigned components into the final system implementation.
	In this context, a general-purpose microprocessor provides a sophisticated
	low-cost component that can be tailored to realize most system functions
	through appropriate software. This approach is particularly useful
	in the design of embedded systems that have a relatively simple target
	architecture, when compared to general-purpose computing systems
	such as workstations. In embedded systems the processor is used as
	a resource dedicated to implement specific functions. However, the
	design issues in embedded systems are complicated since most of these
	systems operate in a time-constrained environment. Recent advances
	in chip-level synthesis have made it possible to synthesize application-specific
	circuits under strict timing constraints. This dissertation formulates
	the problem of computer-aided design of embedded systems using both
	application-specific as well as general-purpose reprogrammable components
	under timing constraints.
	
	Given a specification of system functionality and constraints in a
	hardware description language, we model the system as a set of bilogic
	flow graphs, and formulate the co-synthesis problem as a partitioning
	problem under constraints. Timing constraints are used to determine
	the parts of the system functionality that are delegated to applicationspecific
	hardware and the software that runs on the processor. The software
	component of such a `mixed' system poses an interesting problem due
	to its interaction with concurrently operating hardware. We address
	this problem by generating software as a set of concurrent fixed-latency
	serialized operations called threads. The satisfaction of the imposed
	performance constraints is then ensured by exploiting concurrency
	between program threads, achieved by an inter-leaved execution on
	a single processor system.
	
	This co-synthesis of hardware and software from behavioral specifications
	makes it possible to build time-constrained embedded systems by using
	off-the-shelf parts and application-specific circuitry. Due to the
	reduction in size of application-specific hardware needed compared
	to an all-hardware solution, the needed hardware component can be
	easily mapped to semicustom VLSI such as gate arrays, thus shortening
	the design time. In addition, the ability to perform a detailed analysis
	of timing performance provides an opportunity to improve the system
	definition by creating better prototypes. The algorithms and techniques
	described have been implemented in a framework called Vulcan, which
	is integrated with the Stanford Olympus Synthesis System and provides
	a path from chip-level synthesis to system-level synthesis.},

  abstract = {In many parallel applications, each computation entity (process, thread
	etc.) switches the bulk of its communication between a small group
	of other entities. We call this phenomenon switching locality. The
	Interconnection Cached Network (ICN) is a reconfigurable network
	especially suited for exploiting switching locality. It consists
	of many small, fast crossbars interconnected by a large, slow switching
	crossbar. The large crossbar is used for topology reconfiguration
	and the smaller crossbars for circuit switching. For a large class
	of communication patterns displaying switching locality (this includes
	meshes, tori, trees, rings, pyramids, etc.), it is possible to choose
	appropriate ICN configurations and assignments of processes to processors
	such that all communication paths pass through two or less switching
	components. Much of the previous work on performance analysis of
	networks has assumed random, uniformly distributed communication
	and is inapplicable to many real-life parallel applications that
	lack this uniformity. We develop a methodology to analyze the performance
	of synchronous, circuit switched networks under different communication
	traffic patterns. We employ this methodology to study the performance
	of the ICN in comparison to more popular reconfigurable networks:
	the delta and the crossbar. We choose two different communication
	patterns -- a 2-D torus representing a high degree of switching locality
	and a fully connected graph representing complete absence of such
	locality. We show that in the presence of locality, the ICN comes
	very close to matching the crossbar's performance. This, together
	with the shorter network cycle period of the ICN, makes it more desirable.
	In the absence of switching locality, the reconfigurability of the
	ICN allows for a graceful degradation in performance.},

  abstract = {Many computationally-intensive programs, such as those for differential
	equations, spatial interpolation, and dynamic programming, spend
	a large portion of their execution time in multiply-nested loops
	that have a regular stencil of data dependences. Tiling is a well-known
	compiler optimization that improves performance on such loops, particularly
	for computers with a multileveled hierarchy of parallelism and memory.
	Most previous work on tiling is limited in at least one of the following
	ways: they only handle nested loops of depth two, orthogonal tiling,
	or rectangular tiles. In our work, we tile loop nests of arbitrary
	depth using polyhedral tiles. We derive a prediction formula for
	the execution time of such tiled loops, which can be used by a compiler
	to automatically determine the tiling parameters that minimizes the
	execution time. We also explain the notion of rise, a measure of
	the relationship between the shape of the tiles and the shape of
	the iteration space generated by the loop nest. The rise is a powerful
	tool in predicting the execution time of a tiled loop. It allows
	us to reason about how the tiling affects the length of the longest
	path of dependent tiles, which is a measure of the execution time
	of a tiling. We use a model of the tiled iteration space that allows
	us to determine the length of the longest path of dependent tiles
	using linear programming. Using the rise, we derive a simple formula
	for the length of the longest path of dependent tiles in rectilinear
	iteration spaces, a subclass of the convex iteration spaces, and
	show how to choose the optimal tile shape.},

	In May 2002, the ES was acknowledged to be the most powerful computer
	in the world: 35.86 teraflop/s for the LINPACK HPC benchmark and
	26.58 teraflop/s for an atmospheric general circulation code (AFES).
	Such a remarkable performance may be attributed to the following

	high-bandwidth non-blocking interconnection crossbar network.
	
	The ES consists of 640 processor nodes (PN) and an interconnection
	network (IN), which are housed in 320 PN cabinets and 65 IN cabinets.
	The ES is installed in a specially designed building, 65 m long,
	50 m wide and 17 m high. In order to accomplish this advanced system,
	many kinds of hardware technologies have been developed, such as
	a high-density and high-frequency LSI, a high-frequency signal transmission,
	a high-density packaging, and a high-efficiency cooling and power
	supply system with low noise so as to reduce whole volume of the

	SMPs with scalable technology, we propose new scalable techniques
	that allow large SMPs to be tied together efficiently, while maintaining
	the compatibility with, and performance characteristics of, an SMP.
	The trade-offs of such an architecture differ from those of traditional,
	scalable, Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (cc-NUMA) approaches.WildFire
	is a distributed shared-memory (DSM) prototype implementation based
	on large SMPs. It relies on two techniques for creating application-transparent
	locality: Coherent Memory Replication (CMR), which is a variation
	of Simple COMA/Reactive NUMA, and Hierarchical Affinity Scheduling
	(HAS). These two optimizations create extra node locality, which
	blurs the node boundaries to an application such that SMP-like performance
	can be achieved with no NUMA-specific optimizations.We present a
	performance study of a large OLTP benchmark running on DSMs built
	from various-sized nodes and with varying amounts of application-transparent
	locality. WildFire's measured performance is shown to be more than
	two times that of an unoptimized NUMA implementation built from small
	nodes and within 13\% of the performance of the ideal implementation:
	a large SMP with the same access time to its entire shared memory

	Building on an area-efficient shared cache design, the proposed scheme

	the average L2 access latency. Cache blocks are continuously monitored
	and the locations of the optimal corresponding cache banks are predicted
	to effectively alleviate the impact of non uniform cache access latency.
	By adopting migration alone without replication, the exclusiveness
	of cache blocks is maintained thus further optimizing the miss rate.
	Simulation results using a full systemsimulator demonstrate that
	the proposed controlled migration scheme outperforms the shared caching
	strategy and compares favorably with previously proposed replication

	machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification
	and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer
	real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units.
	Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition
	diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively,
	with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These
	transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured
	and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact
	and expressive?small diagrams can express complex behavior?as
	well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities
	of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description
	at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications
	manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate
	here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against
	conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification
	by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can
	be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part
	of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's
	other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification.
	We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the
	last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification
	of a particularly complex system.},

	Reconfigurable computing systems join microprocessors and programmable

	hardware and software and have been used in applications ranging
	from embedded systems to high performance computing. Many of the
	fundamental theories have been identified and used by the Hardware/Software

	approaches.This book is intended as an introduction to the entire
	range of issues important to reconfigurable computing, using FPGAs
	as the context, or computing vehicles to implement this powerful
	technology. It will take a reader with a background in the basics
	of digital design and software programming and provide them with

  abstract = {Parallel processing in computer systems is gaining importance: not
	only supercomputers, but today also desktop and laptop computers
	have multiple processors. To make all these processors work efficiently
	on a single problem, they have to communicate. To this end, processors
	are connected to each other, and to the outside world, through a
	communication network. This network should allow a fast exchange
	of information, such that the processors receive new data to process
	in a timely manner. Current technologies, using electrical signaling,
	are reaching the end of their capabilities, however. Moreover, the
	traffic on such networks is very irregular, making some parts of
	the network highly saturated while other parts are barely used. The
	precise patterns also depend on the application, and can even change
	during the run time of a single application. This makes it very difficult
	to build an efficient communication network. This doctoral dissertation
	explores the possibilities of optical, reconfigurable networks. Optical
	connections are one part of the solution to the communication problem,
	since they allow for much higher data rates. Moreover, optics allows
	the network to be reconfigured, during the course of a program, in
	a data-transparent way, to the current traffic patterns. This way,
	all network connections are utilized more efficiently, which can
	both increase the network`s performance and reduce power usage.},

	Multi-Threaded Processor (JMTP) provides solutions to these problems.
	The JMTP architecture is a single chip containing an off-the-shelf
	general purpose processor core coupled with an array of {Java} Thread
	Processors (JTPs). Performance can be improved using this architecture
	by exploiting coarse-grained parallelism in the application. These
	performance improvements are achieved with relatively small hardware
	costs. Runtime predictability is improved by implementing a subset
	of the {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM) specification in the JTP and
	trimming away complexity without excessively restricting the {Java}
	code a JTP can handle. Moreover, the JMTP architecture incorporates
	hardware to adaptively manage shared JMTP resources in order to satisfy
	JTP thread timing constraints or provide an early warning for a timing
	violation. This is an important feature for applications with quality-of-service
	demands. In addition to the hardware architecture, we describe a
	software framework that analyzes a {Java} application for expressed
	and implicit coarse-grained concurrent threads to execute on JTPs.
	This framework identifies the optimal mapping of an application to
	a JMTP with an arbitrary number of JTPs. We have tested this framework
	on a variety of applications including IDEA encryption with different
	JTP configurations and confirmed that the algorithm was able to obtain
	desired results in each case.},

  abstract = {Power estimation and optimization has become a key issue in embedded
	system design, especially in the rapidly growing market of mobile
	handbeld computing, communication, internet devices that are driven
	by battery power. It is of paramount importance to estimate and optimize
	power of those systems during an early design stage at a high level
	of abstraction in order to efficiently explore the design space and
	to take full advantage of the related high optimization potential.
	
	
	In this paper, we present Avalanche, a prototyping framework that
	addresses the issues of power estimation and optimization for mixed
	hardware and software embedded systems. Avalanche is based on a generic
	embedded system architecture consisting of embedded CPU, custom hardware,
	and a memory hierarchy. For system-level power estimation, given
	various system parameters like cache sizes, cache policies, and bus
	width, etc., Avalanche is able to rapidly evaluate/estimate power
	and performance and thus facilitate comprehensive design space explorations.
	For system-level power optimization, Avalanche offers different modes
	reflecting various design scenarios: if no hardware/software partitioning
	or only partial partitioning has been conducted, Avalanche guides
	the designer in finding power-aware hardware/software partitioning;
	when a system has already been partitioned, Avalanche can optimize
	system parameters such as cache and memory size; if system parameters
	and partitioning are given, Avalanche applies additional optimizations
	for power including source-to-source compiler transformations.
	
	Avalanche has been deployed during the design phase of real-world
	applications including an MPEG 11 encoder in a set-top box design.
	Extensive design space explorations in terms of power and performance
	could be conducted within several hours and various optimization
	techniques led to power reductions of up to 94 \% without performance
	losses and only a slight increases in total chip size (i.e., transistor
	count).},

	Giotto can be annotated with platform constraints such as task-tohost

	directives for the Giotto compiler, but they do not alter the functionality

	from the platformdependent concerns, Giotto enables a great deal
	of flexibility in choosing control platforms as well as a great deal

	The timetriggered nature of Giotto achieves timing predictability,

  abstract = {Modern garbage collectors partition the set of heap objects to achieve
	the best performance. For example, generational garbage collectors
	partition objects by age and focus their efforts on the youngest
	objects. Partitioning by age works well for many programs because
	younger objects usually have short lifetimes and thus garbage collection
	of young objects is often able to free up many objects. However,
	generational garbage collectors are typically much less efficient
	for longer-lived objects, and thus prior work has proposed many enhancements
	to generational collection.
	
	Our work explores whether the connectivity of objects can yield useful
	partitions or improve existing partitioning schemes. We look at both
	direct (e.g., object A points to object B) and transitive (e.g.,
	object A is reachable from object B) connectivity. Our results indicate
	that connectivity correlates strongly with object lifetimes and deathtimes
	and is therefore likely to be useful for partitioning objects.},

  abstract = {The operation-centric hardware abstraction is useful for describing
	systems whose behavior exhibits a high degree of concurrency. In
	the operation-centric style, the behavior of a system is described
	as a collection of operations on a set of state elements. Each operation
	is specified as a predicate and a set of simultaneous state-element
	updates, which may only take effect in case the predicate is true
	on the current state values. The effect of an operation's state updates
	is atomic, that is, the legal behaviors of the system constitute
	some sequential interleaving of the operations. This atomic and sequential
	execution semantics permits each operation to be formulated as if
	the rest of the system were frozen and thus simplifies the description
	of concurrent systems. This paper presents an approach to synthesize
	an efficient synchronous digital implementation from an operation-centric
	hardware-design description. The resulting implementation carries
	out multiple operations per clock cycle and yet maintains the semantics
	that is consistent with the atomic and sequential execution of operations.
	The paper defines, and then gives algorithms to identify, conflict-free
	and sequentially composable operations that can be performed in the
	same clock cycle. The paper further gives an algorithm to generate
	the hardwired arbitration logic to coordinate the concurrent execution
	of conflict-free and sequentially composable operations. Lastly,
	the paper evaluates synthesis results based on the TRAC compiler
	for the TRSPEC operation-centric hardware-description language. The
	results from a pipelined processor example show that an operation-centric
	framework offers a significant reduction in design time, while achieving
	comparable implementation quality as traditional register-transfer-level
	design flows.},

  abstract = {This paper presents remote store programming (RSP). This paradigm
	combines usability and efficiency through the exploitation of a simple
	hardware mechanism, the remote store, which can easily be added to
	existing multicores. Remote store programs are marked by fine-grained
	and one-sided communication which results in a stream of data flowing
	from the registers of a sending process to the cache of a destination
	process. The RSP model and its hardware implementation trade a relatively
	high store latency for a low load latency because loads are more
	common than stores, and it is easier to tolerate store latency than
	load latency. This paper demonstrates the performance advantages
	of remote store programming by comparing it to both cache-coherent
	shared memory and direct memory access (DMA) based approaches using
	the TILEPro64 processor. The paper studies two applications: a two-dimensional
	Fast Fourier Transform (2D FFT) and an H.264 encoder for high-definition
	video. For a 2D FFT using 56 cores, RSP is 1.64? faster than DMA
	and 4.4? faster than shared memory. For an H.264 encoder using
	40 cores, RSP achieves the same performance as DMA and 4.8? the
	performance of shared memory. Along with these performance advantages,
	RSP requires the least hardware support of the three. RSP?s features,

  abstract = {The ability to tune the frequency of an oscillator is of critical
	importance and is a fundamental building block for many systems,
	be they mechanical or electronic. However, this very important function
	is still highly inadequate in optical oscillators, particularly in
	semiconductor laser diodes. The limitations in tuning a laser frequency
	(or wavelength) include the tuning range and the speed of tuning,
	which is typically milliseconds or slower. In addition, the tuning
	is often not continuous and may require complex synchronization of
	several electrical control signals. In this Letter, we present a
	new tunable laser structure with a lightweight nanoelectromechanical
	mirror based on a single-layer, high-contrast subwavelength grating.
	The high-contrast subwavelength grating reflector enables a drastic
	reduction of the mirror mass, which increases the mechanical resonant
	frequency and hence tuning speed. This allows for a wavelength-tunable
	light source with potential switching speeds of the order of tens
	of nanoseconds and suggests various new areas of practical application,
	such as bio- or chemical sensing, chip-scale atomic clocks and projection
	displays.},

	These applications are important in defining the design and performance
	decisions of future high performance microprocessors. This paper
	presents a detailed data-sharing analysis and chip-multiprocessor
	(CMP) cache study of several multi-threaded data-mining bioinformatics
	workloads. For a CMP with a three-level cache hierarchy, we model
	the last-level of the cache hierarchy as either multiple private
	caches or a single cache shared amongst different cores of the CMP.
	Our experiments show that the bioinformatics workloads exhibit significant
	data-sharing -- 50-95\% of the data cache is shared by the different
	threads of the workload. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of
	data cache shared, for some workloads, as many as 98\% of the accesses
	to the last-level cache are to shared data cache lines. Additionally,
	the amount of data-sharing exhibited by the workloads is a function
	of the total cache size available -- the larger the data cache the
	better the sharing behavior. Thus, partitioning the available last-level
	cache silicon area into multiple private caches can cause applications
	to lose their inherent data-sharing behavior. For the workloads in
	this study, a shared 32MB last-level cache is able to capture a tremendous
	amount of data-sharing and outperform a 32MB private cache configuration
	by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, with shared last-level
	caches, the bandwidth demands beyond the last-level cache can be
	reduced by factors of 3-625 when compared to private last-level caches.},

	FPGA-based computers from parallel C programs. The Streams-C language
	consists of a small number of libraries and intrinsic functions added
	to a synthesizable subset of C, and supports a communicating process
	programming model. The processes may be either software or hardware
	processes, and the compiler manages communication among the processes
	transparently to the programmer. For the hardware processes, the
	compiler generates Register-Transfer-Level (RTL) VHDL, targeting
	multiple FPGAs with dedicated memories. For the software processes,
	a multi-threaded software program is generated.The Streams-C language
	and compiler offer a very high level of expressivity for reconfigurable
	computing application development, particularly for stream-processing
	applications. We find this is reflected in productivity, for a factor
	of up to 10 times improvement in time to produce a program. However,
	use of the tool in the ``real world'' is predicated on performance:
	only if such a compiler can deliver performance comparable to hand-coded
	performance will it be used in practice.This paper presents an application
	study of the Streams-C compiler. Four applications have been written
	in Streams-C and compiled to the AMC Wildforce board containing Xilinx
	4036's. Those same applications have been hand-coded in a combination
	of RTL and structural VHDL. We compare performance of the generated
	code with the hand-optimized code. Our study shows that the compiler-generated
	designs are 1.37--4 times the area and $1/2$--1 times the clock frequency
	of the hand designs. We find that the compiler, based on the SUIF
	infrastructure, can be greatly improved through various standard
	compiler optimizations that are not currently being exploited. Thus
	we are currently re-writing a public domain version of Streams-C
	to better optimize and target the Virtex chip.},

	We reduce the HW/SW partitioning problem to a variation of knapsack
	problem that is approximately solved by searching 1D solution space,
	instead of searching 2D solution space in the latest work cited in
	this paper, to reduce time complexity. Three heuristic algorithms
	are proposed to determine suitable partitions to satisfy HW/SW partitioning
	constraints. We have shown that the time complexity for partitioning
	a graph with n nodes and m edges is significantly reduced from O(d<sub>x</sub>
	? d<sub>y</sub> ? n3) to O(n log n + d ? (n + m)), where d
	and d<sub>x</sub> ? d<sub>y</sub> are the number of the fragments
	of the searched 1D solution space and the searched 2D solution space,
	respectively. The lower bound on the solution quality is also proposed
	based on the new computing model to show that it is comparable to
	that reported in the literature. Moreover, empirical results show
	that the proposed algorithms produce comparable and often better
	solutions when compared to the latest algorithm while reducing the

	Miss caching places a small, fully associative cache between a cache

	are shown to be very effective in removing mapping conflict misses

	to miss caching in that it loads the small fully associative cache
	with the victim of a miss and not the requested line. Small victim
	caches of 1 to 5 entries are even more effective at removing conflict
	misses than miss caching. Stream buffers prefetch cache lines starting
	at a cache miss address. The prefetched data are placed in the buffer

	misses. An extension to the basic stream buffer, called a multiway

  abstract = {We are interested in optimizing the design of multifunction embedded
	systems such as multistandard audio/video codecs and multisystem
	phones. Such systems run a prespecified set of applications, and
	any "one" of the applications is selected at a run time, depending
	on system parameters. Our goal is to develop a methodology for the
	efficient design of such systems. A key observation underlying our
	method is that it may not be efficient to design for each application
	separately. This is attributed to two factors. First, considering
	each application in isolation can lead to application-specific decisions
	that do not necessarily lead to the best overall system solution.
	Second, these applications typically tend to have several commonalities
	among them, and considering applications independently may lead to
	inconsistent mappings of common tasks in different applications.
	Our approach is to optimize jointly across the set of applications
	while ensuring that each application itself meets its timing constraints.
	Based on these guiding principles, we formulate, as a codesign problem,
	the design and synthesis of an efficient hardware-software implementation
	for a multifunction embedded system. The first step in our methodology
	is to identify nodes that represent similar functionality across
	different applications. Such "common" nodes are characterized by
	several metrics such as their repetitions, urgency, concurrency,
	and performance/area tradeoff. These metrics are quantified and used
	by a hardware/software partitioning tool to influence hardware/software
	mapping decisions. The idea behind this is to bias common tasks toward
	the same resource as far as possible while also considering preferences
	and timing constraints local to each application. Further, relative
	criticality of applications is also considered, and the mapping decisions
	in more critical applications are allowed to influence those in less
	critical applications. We demonstrate how this is achieved by modifying
	an existing partitioning algorithm (GCLP) used to partition single-function
	systems. Our modified algorithm considers global preferences across
	the application set as well as the preference of each individual
	application to generate an efficient overall solution while ensuring
	that timing constraints of each application are met. The overall
	result of the system-level partitioning process is 1) a hardware
	or software mapping and 2) a schedule for execution for each node
	within the application set. On an example set consisting of three
	video applications, we show that the solution obtained by the use
	of our method is 38% smaller than that obtained when each application
	is considered independently.},

	performance of a sequence of loop nests through a combination of
	loop and data layout transformations. Pure loop transformations are
	restricted by data dependencies and may not be very successful in
	optimizing imperfectly nested loops and explicitly parallelized programs.
	Although pure data transformations are not constrained by data dependencies,
	the impact of a data transformation on an array might be program-wide;
	that is, it can affect all the references to that array in all the
	loop nests. Therefore, in this paper we argue for an integrated approach
	that employs both loop and data transformations. The method enjoys
	the advantages of most of the previous techniques for enhancing locality
	and is efficient. In our approach, the loop nests in a program are
	processed one by one and the data layout constraints obtained from
	one nest are propagated for optimizing the remaining loop nests.
	We show a simple and effective matrix-based framework to implement
	this process. The search space that we consider for possible loop
	transformations can be represented by general nonsingular linear
	transformation matrices and the data layouts that we consider are
	those that can be expressed using hyperplanes. Experiments with several
	floating-point programs on an 8-processor SGI Origin 2000 distributed-shared-memory

	since the early 2000's mainly for processors and Sw approach but
	less for reconfigurable Hw or DSP implementation. This paper deals
	with a specific architecture and an innovative design methodology
	which were designed within the framework of a fully flexible high
	data rate Software Defined Radio wireless modem. This approach is
	focused on the waveform part of the system and its goal is to reach
	a fully flexible physical layer. In case of modem evolutions or upgrades,
	it enables to avoid significant rework and extra cost in term of
	waveform development. Moreover the association of the right architecture
	and the right methodology allows to master and to manage the complexity
	of the modem (which presents several hundred configurations available
	with different kind of parameters) and permits to provide the needed
	flexibility. The development methodology is based on a C/C++ approach
	which allows to manage all the parameters at a system level. The
	architecture coupled to this development methodology offers a high
	level of modularity which enables to easily modify the waveform only
	in replacing blocks by other blocks. The efficiency and the flexibility
	of the modem is then obtained by designing not a single waveform
	but a waveforms family.},

	of four-dimensional (4-D) medical images (sequences of volumetric
	images over time) by using a combination of three-dimensional (3-D)
	integer wavelet transform (IWT) and 3-D motion compensation. A 3-D
	extension of the set-partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm
	is employed for coding the wavelet coefficients. To effectively exploit
	the redundancy between consecutive 3-D images, the concepts of key
	and residual frames from video coding is used. A fast 3-D cube matching
	algorithm is employed to do motion estimation. The key and the residual
	volumes are then coded using 3-D IWT and the modified 3-D SPIHT.
	The experimental results presented in this paper show that our proposed

	performance on 4-D medical images when compared with JPEG-2000 and

	Element (PPE) and eight Synergistic Processing
	
	Elements (SPEs). Its high computational performance is
	
	achieved mainly through the SPE?s processing power.
	
	New high-speed NICs such as 10-Gbps Ethernet require
	
	significant amounts of processing power. Even the full processing
	
	power of PPE is insufficient to attain the maximum
	
	bandwidth on 10-Gbps Ethernet, when running Linux on
	
	Cell Broadband EngineTM.
	
	In order to avoid the bottlenecks of PPE processing, we
	
	implemented a NIC driver and a protocol stack on an SPE.
	
	We selected a small protocol stack that is designed for embedded
	
	systems and made size reductions to put both a protocol
	
	stack and a NIC driver onto a single SPE. Due to the
	
	size limitation of the SPE?s local storage (256-KB).
	
	As a result, the protocol processing on an SPE is almost
	
	at wire speed for UDP and about 8.5 Gbps for TCP with
	
	lightly tuned code, and it requires no assistance from the
	
	PPE while in the data transfer phase.
	
	Our work shows that the use of the SPE instead of the
	
	PPE for network processing can help resolve network performance
	
	problems that can arise from handling a highspeed
	
	NIC, including the costs of protocol processing and
	
	memory copies.
	
	The results indicate that our approach can lead to a sufficient
	
	level of transfer rate performance.},

	The standard technique for {Java} execution is interpretation, which
	provides for extensive portability of programs. A {Java} interpreter
	dynamically executes {Java} bytecodes, which comprise the instruction
	set of the {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM). Execution time performance
	of {Java} programs can be improved through compilation, possibly
	at the expense of portability. Various types of {Java} compilers
	have been proposed, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that compile
	bytecodes into native processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers
	that directly translate the {Java} source code into the target processor?s
	native language; and bytecode-to-source translators that generate
	either native code or an intermediate language, such as C, from the
	bytecodes. Additional techniques, including bytecode optimization,
	dynamic compilation, and executing {Java} programs in parallel, attempt
	to improve {Java} run-time performance while maintaining {Java}?s
	portability. Another alternative for executing {Java} programs is
	a {Java} processor that implements the JVM directly in hardware.
	In this survey, we discuss the basic features, and the advantages
	and disadvantages, of the various {Java} execution techniques. We
	also discuss the various {Java} benchmarks that are being used by

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a scalable architecture
	suitable for large-scale distributed shared memory (DSM) systems.
	The approach is based on an interconnect technology which combines
	optical components and a novel architecture design. In DSM systems,
	numerous shared memory transactions such as requests, responses and
	acknowledgment messages propagate simultaneously in the network.
	As the network size increases, network contention results in increasing
	the critical remote memory access latency, which significantly penalizes
	the performance of DSM systems. In our proposed architecture called
	reconfigurable and scalable all-photonic interconnect for distributed-shared
	memory (font color=990000>RAPID/b>), we provide high connectivity
	by maximizing the channel availability for remote communication to
	reduce the critical remote latency. RAPID provides fast and efficient
	unicast, multicast and broadcast capabilities using a combination
	of aggressively designed wavelength division multiplexing (WDM),
	time division multiplexing (TDM), and space division multiplexing
	(SDM) techniques. RAPID is wavelength-routed, permitting the same
	limited set of wavelength to be reused among all processors. We evaluated
	RAPID based on network characteristics, power budget criteria, and
	by simulation using synthetic traffic workloads and compared it against
	other networks such as electrical ring, torus, mesh, and hypercube
	networks. We found that RAPID outperforms all networks and still
	provides good performance as the network is scaled to very large
	numbers.},

	The proposed infrastructure, referred to as CONoC, facilitates the
	development of an all-optical on-chip network and alleviates the
	role of electrical NoCs. As the first step for designing an all-optical
	NoC, CONoC resolves packet congestions optically and does not use
	electrical methods. Utilizing wavelength routing method, wavelength
	division multiplexing, and path reconfiguration capability in CONoC
	leads to a contention-free architecture. This architectural advantage
	along with simple and small photonic router architecture results
	in simple electrical transactions, reduced setup latency, and high
	transmission capacity. Moreover, we discuss the proper topology for
	on-chip optical interconnects. Performing a series of simulation-based

  abstract = {Scalable shared-memory multiprocessors are often slowed down by long-latency
	memory accesses. One way to cope with this problem is to use data
	forwarding to overlap memory accesses with computation. With data
	forwarding, when a processor produces a datum, in addition to updating
	its cache, it sends a copy of the datum to the caches of the processors
	that the compiler identified as consumers of it. As a result, when
	the consumer processors access the datum, they find it in their caches.
	This paper addresses two main issues. First, it presents a framework
	for a compiler algorithm for forwarding. Second, using address traces,
	it evaluates the performance impact of different levels of support
	for forwarding. Our simulations of a 32-processor machine show that
	an optimistic support for forwarding speeds up five applications
	by an average of 50\% for large caches and 30\% for small caches.
	For large caches, most sharing read misses are eliminated, while
	for small caches, forwarding does not increase the number of conflict
	misses significantly. Overall, support for forwarding in shared-memory
	multiprocessors promises to deliver good application speedups.},

	scheduling, allocation, and module selection. For today's very large-scale
	integration (VLSI) designs, the cost of solving the combined scheduling,
	allocation, and module selection problem by exhaustive search is
	prohibitive. However, to meet design objectives, an extensive design
	space exploration is often critical to obtaining superior designs.
	We present a framework for efficient design space exploration during
	high-level synthesis of datapaths for data-dominated applications.
	The framework uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to concurrently perform
	scheduling and allocation with the aim of finding schedules and module
	combinations that lead to superior designs while considering user-specified
	latency and area constraints. The GA uses a multichromosome representation
	to encode datapath schedules and module allocations and efficient
	heuristics to minimize functional and storage area costs, while minimizing
	circuit latencies. The framework provides the flexibility to perform
	resource-constrained scheduling, time-constrained scheduling, or
	a combination of the two, using a simple and fast list-scheduling
	technique. A graded penalty function is used as an objective function
	in evaluating the quality of designs to enable the GA to quickly
	reach areas of the search space where designs meeting user specified
	criteria are most likely to be found. Since GAs are population-based
	search heuristics, a unique feature of our framework is its ability
	to offer a large number of alternative datapath designs, all of which
	meet design specifications but differ in module, register, and interconnect
	configurations. Many experiments on well-known benchmarks show the
	effectiveness of our approach.},

	require building, computing with, and modifying large sparse graphs.
	In the parallel programming literature, these types of applications

	in shared buses and dedicated links, packet-switched
	
	on-chip interconnection networks are fast emerging as the
	
	pervasive communication fabric to connect dierent processing
	
	elements in many-core chips. However, current state-ofthe-
	
	art packet-switched networks rely on complex routers
	
	which increases the communication overhead and energy
	
	consumption as compared to the ideal interconnection fabric.
	
	In this paper, we try to close the gap between the stateof-
	
	the-art packet-switched network and the ideal interconnect
	
	by proposing express virtual channels (EVCs), a novel
	
	
	ow control mechanism which allows packets to virtually bypass
	
	intermediate routers along their path in a completely
	
	non-speculative fashion, thereby lowering the energy/delay
	
	towards that of a dedicated wire while simultaneously approaching
	
	ideal throughput with a practical design suitable
	
	for on-chip networks.
	
	Our evaluation results using a detailed cycle-accurate simulator
	
	on a range of synthetic trac and SPLASH benchmark
	
	traces show upto 84% reduction in packet latency and
	
	upto 23% improvement in throughput while reducing the average
	
	router energy consumption by upto 38% over an existing
	
	state-of-the-art packet-switched design. When compared
	
	to the ideal interconnect, EVCs add just two cycles to the
	
	no-load latency, and are within 14% of the ideal throughput.
	
	Moreover, we show that the proposed design incurs a minimal
	
	hardware overhead while exhibiting excellent scalability

	language. Its combination of object-oriented programming features,
	its automatic garbage collection, and its poor support for real-time
	multi-threading are all seen as particular impediments. The Real-Time
	Specification for {Java} has introduced many new features that help
	in the real-time domain. However, the expressive power of these features
	means that very complex programming models can be created, necessitating
	complexity in the supporting real-time virtual machine. Consequently,
	{Java}, with the real-time extensions as they stand, seems too complex
	for confident use in high integrity systems. This paper presents
	a {Java} profile for the development of software-intensive high integrity
	real-time systems. This restricted programming model removes language
	features with high overheads and complex semantics, on which it is
	hard to perform timing and functional analyses. The profile fits
	within the J2ME framework and is consistent with well-known guidelines
	for high integrity software development, such as those defined by

	exchange points. Internet routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation
	of network reachability information, is an important problem currently
	facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network
	instability can lead to packet loss, increased network latency and
	time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability
	have led to the loss of internal connectivity in wide-area, national
	networks. We describe several unexpected trends in routing instability,
	and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the
	exchange of inter-domain routing information. The analysis in this
	paper is based on data collected from border gateway protocol (BGP)
	routing messages generated by border routers at five of the Internet
	core's public exchange points during a nine month period. We show
	that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of magnitude
	more than expected and that the majority of this routing information
	is redundant, or pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals
	several unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic properties in
	Internet routing. We finally posit a number of explanations for these
	anomalies and evaluate their potential impact on the Internet infrastructure},

	local regions of code have limited parallelism, and control dependence
	analysis is useful in extracting global parallelism from different
	parts of a program. Second, a superscalar processor is fundamentally
	limited because it cannot execute independent regions of code concurrently.
	Higher performance can be obtained with machines, such as multiprocessors
	and dataflow machines, that can simultaneously follow multiple flows
	of control. Finally, without speculative execution to allow instructions
	to execute before their control dependences are resolved, only modest
	amounts of parallelism can be obtained for programs with complex

  abstract = {The SGI Origin 2000 is a cache-coherent non-uniform memory access
	(ccNUMA) multiprocessor designed and manufactured by Silicon Graphics,
	Inc. The Origin system was designed from the ground up as a multiprocessor
	capable of scaling to both small and large processor counts without
	any bandwidth, latency, or cost cliffs. The Origin system consists
	of up to 512 nodes interconnected by a scalable Craylink network.
	Each node consists of one or two R10000 processors, up to 4 GB of
	coherent memory, and a connection to a portion of the XIO IO subsystem.
	This paper discusses the motivation for building the Origin 2000
	and then describes its architecture and implementation. In addition,
	performance results are presented for the NAS Parallel Benchmarks
	V2.2 and the SPLASH2 applications. Finally, the Origin system is
	compared to other contemporary commercial ccNUMA systems.},

	processing software environments and experimentally and other contexts.
	We give this model the name ldquo;dataflow process networks, rdquo;
	and study its formal properties as well as its utility as a basis
	for programming language design. Variants of this model are used
	in commercial visual programming systems such as SPW from the Alta
	Group of Cadence (formerly Comdisco Systems), COSSAP from Synopsys
	(formerly Cadis), the DSP Station from Mentor Graphics, and Hypersignal
	from Hyperception. They are also used in research software such as
	Khoros from the University of New Mexico and Ptolemy from the University
	of California at Berkeley, among many others. Dataflow process networks
	are shown to be a special case of Kahn process networks, a model
	of computation where a number of concurrent processes communicate
	through unidirectional FIFO channels, where writes to the channel
	are nonblocking, and reads are blocking. In dataflow process networks,
	each process consists of repeated ldquo;firings rdquo; of a dataflow
	ldquo;actor. rdquo; An actor defines a (often functional) quantum
	of computation. By dividing processes into actor firings, the considerable
	overhead of context switching incurred in most implementations of
	Kahn process networks is avoided. We relate dataflow process networks
	to other dataflow models, including those used in dataflow machines,
	such as static dataflow and the tagged-token model. We also relate
	dataflow process networks to functional languages such as Haskell,
	and show that modern language concepts such as higher-order functions
	and polymorphism can be used effectively in dataflow process networks.
	A number of programming examples using a visual syntax are given},

  year = {2002},
  volume = {24},
  pages = {1--50},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {To exploit parallelism on shared memory parallel computers (SMPCs),
	it is natural to focus on decomposing the computation (mainly by
	distributing the iterations of the nested Do-Loops). In contrast,
	on distributed memory parallel computers (DMPCs), the decomposition
	of computation and the distribution of data must both be handled---in
	order to balance the computation load and to minimize the migration
	of data. We propose and validate experimentally a method for handling
	computations and data synergistically to minimize the overall execution
	time on DMPCs. The method is based on a number of novel techniques,
	also presented in this article. The core idea is to rank the "importance"
	of data arrays in a program and specify some of the dominant. The
	intuition is that the dominant arrays are the ones whose migration
	would be the most expensive. Using the correspondence between iteration
	space mapping vectors and distributed dimensions of the dominant
	data array in each nested Do-loop, allows us to design algorithms
	for determining data and computation decompositions at the same time.
	Based on data distribution, computation decomposition for each nested
	Do-loop is determined based on either the "owner computes" rule or
	the "owner stores" rule with respect to the dominant data array.
	If all temporal dependence relations across iteration partitions
	are regular, we use tiling to allow pipelining and the overlapping
	of computation and communication. However, in order to use tiling
	on DMPCs, we needed to extend the existing techniques for determining
	tiling vectors and tile sizes, as they were originally suited for
	SMPCs only. The overall method is illustrated on programs for the
	2D heat equation, for the Gaussian elimination with pivoting, and
	for the 2D fast Fourier transform on a linear processor array and
	on a 2D processor grid.},

  month = {July},
  year = {1975},
  abstract = {Lex helps write programs whose control flow is directed by instances
	of regular expressions in the input stream. It is well suited for
	editor-script type transformations and for segmenting input in preparation
	for a parsing routine. Lex source is a table of regular expressions
	and corresponding program fragments. The table is translated to a
	program which reads an input stream, copying it to an output stream
	and partitioning the input into strings which match the given expressions.
	As each such string is recognized the corresponding program fragment
	is executed. The recognition of the expressions is performed by a
	deterministic finite automaton generated by Lex. The program fragments
	written by the user are executed in the order in which the corresponding
	regular expressions occur in the input stream. The lexical analysis
	programs written with Lex accept ambiguous specifications and choose
	the longest match possible at each input point. If necessary, substantial
	lookahead is performed on the input, but the input stream will be
	backed up to the end of the current partition, so that the user has
	general freedom to manipulate it. Lex can generate analyzers in either
	C or Ratfor, a language which can be translated automatically to
	portable Fortran. It is available on the PDP-11 UNIX, Honeywell GCOS,
	and IBM OS systems. This manual, however, will only discuss generating
	analyzers in C on the UNIX system, which is the only supported form
	of Lex under UNIX Version 7. Lex is designed to simplify interfacing
	with Yacc, for those with access to this compiler-compiler system.},

	techniques for power management on processors that support dynamic
	voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS): user-driven frequency scaling
	(UDFS) and process-driven voltage scaling (PDVS). In PDVS, a CPU-customized
	profile is derived offline that encodes the minimum voltage needed
	to achieve stability at each combination of CPU frequency and temperature.
	On a typical processor, PDVS reduces the voltage below the worst-case
	minimum operating voltages given in datasheets. UDFS, on the other
	hand, dynamically adapts CPU frequency to the individual user and
	the workload through direct user feedback. Our UDFS algorithms dramatically
	reduce typical operating frequencies and voltages while maintaining
	performance at a satisfactory level for each user. We evaluate our
	techniques independently and together through user studies conducted
	on a Pentium M laptop running Windows applications. We measure the

	Combining PDVS and the best UDFS scheme reduces measured system power
	by 49.9% (27.8% PDVS, 22.1% UDFS), averaged across all our users
	and applications, compared to Windows XP DVFS. The average temperature
	of the CPU is decreased by 13.2degC. User trace-driven simulation
	to evaluate the CPU only indicates average CPU dynamic power savings
	of 57.3% (32.4% PDVS, 24.9% UDFS), with a maximum reduction of 83.4%.
	In a multitasking environment, the same UDFS+PDVS technique reduces

	implementation of computationally intensive applications due to high
	flexibility and parallelism. However, one of the main obstacles to
	overcome when trying to accelerate an application on an FPGA is the
	bottleneck in off-chip communication, typically to large memories.
	Often it is known at compile-time that the same data item is accessed
	many times, and as a result can be loaded once from large off-chip
	RAM onto scarce on-chip RAM, alleviating this bottleneck. This paper
	addresses how to automatically derive an address mapping that reduces
	the size of the required on-chip memory for a given memory access
	pattern. Experimental results demonstrate that, in practice, our
	approach reduces on-chip storage requirements to the minimum, corresponding
	to a reduction in on-chip memory size of up to 40? (average 10?)
	for some benchmarks compared to a naive approach. At the same time,
	no clock period penalty or increase in control logic area compared
	to this approach is observed for these benchmarks.},

	program analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation,
	and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation
	system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable,
	transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools
	(called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin
	follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an
	application at the instruction level without the need for detailed
	knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed
	to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools
	source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool
	can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation
	with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe
	the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic
	compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For
	efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register
	re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize
	instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly
	better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example,
	Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for
	basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe
	two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is
	publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32
	(32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium, and ARM. In the ten months
	since Pin 2 was released in July 2004, there have been over 3000

  abstract = {We describe a new processing architecture, known as a {{{{WARP}}}}
	processor, that utilizes a field-programmable gate array ({FPGA})
	to improve the speed and energy consumption of a software binary
	executing on a microprocessor. Unlike previous approaches that also
	improve software using an {FPGA} but do so using a special compiler,
	a {{{{WARP}}}} processor achieves these improvements completely transparently
	and operates from a standard binary. A {{{{WARP}}}} processor dynamically
	detects the binary's critical regions, reimplements those regions
	as a custom hardware circuit in the {FPGA}, and replaces the software
	region by a call to the new hardware implementation of that region.
	While not all benchmarks can be improved using {{{{WARP}}}} processing,
	many can, and the improvements are dramatically better than those
	achievable by more traditional architecture improvements. The hardest
	part of {{{{WARP}}}} processing is that of dynamically reimplementing
	code regions on an {FPGA}, requiring partitioning, decompilation,
	synthesis, placement, and routing tools, all having to execute with
	minimal computation time and data memory so as to coexist on chip
	with the main processor. We describe the results of developing our
	{{{{WARP}}}} processor. We developed a custom {FPGA} fabric specifically
	designed to enable lean place and route tools, and we developed extremely
	fast and efficient versions of partitioning, decompilation, synthesis,
	technology mapping, placement, and routing. {{{WARP}}} processors
	achieve overall application speedups of 6.3X with energy savings
	of 66&percent; across a set of embedded benchmark applications. We
	further show that our tools utilize acceptably small amounts of computation
	and memory which are far less than traditional tools. Our work illustrates
	the feasibility and potential of {{{WARP}}} processing, and we can
	foresee the possibility of {{{WARP}}} processing becoming a feature
	in a variety of computing domains, including desktop, server, and
	embedded applications.},

	virtual machines, as is the case in {Java}, is non-trivial because
	of the tight entanglement at the lowest execution level between the
	application and the virtual machine. This paper proposes {Java}na,
	a system for building {Java} program analysis tools. {Java}na provides
	an easy-to-use instrumentation infrastructure that allows for building
	customized profiling tools very quickly.{Java}na runs a dynamic binary
	instrumentation tool underneath the virtual machine. The virtual
	machine communicates with the instrumentation layer through an event
	handling mechanism for building a vertical map that links low-level
	native instruction pointers and memory addresses to high-level language
	concepts such as objects, methods, threads, lines of code, etc. The
	dynamic binary instrumentation tool then intercepts all memory accesses
	and instructions executed and provides the {Java}na end user with
	high-level language information for all memory accesses and natively
	executed instructions.We demonstrate the power of {Java}na through
	a number of applications: memory address tracing, vertical cache
	simulation and object lifetime computation. For each of these applications,
	the instrumentation specification requires only a small number of
	lines of code. Developing similarly powerful profiling tools within
	a virtual machine (as done in current practice) is both time-consuming
	and error-prone; in addition, the accuracy of the obtained profiling
	results might be questionable as we show in this paper.},

	content of images. The properties of the operator which approximates
	a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the

	by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L2(Rn),
	the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions.
	In L2(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which
	is built by dilating and translating a unique function $\psi(x)$.
	This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation
	called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal
	algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet
	representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For
	images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial
	orientations. The application of this representation to data compression
	in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed},

	the direct two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which
	performs a complete dyadic (i.e., nonstandard) decomposition of an
	N0xN0 image in approximately No2/4 clock cycles (ccs). Therefore,
	it consistently speeds up the performance of other known architectures,
	which commonly need approximately No2 ccs. Also, it has an AT2 complexity,
	which is notably lower than that of other devices based on the "direct
	approach." This result has been achieved by means of carefully balanced
	pipelining and has two "faces." First, PA can be employed for performing
	processing four times faster than allowed by other architectures
	working at the same clock frequency (high-speed utilization), Second,
	it can be employed even using a four times lower clock frequency
	but reaching the same performance as other architectures, This second
	possibility allows one to reduce the supply voltage and the power
	dissipation respectively by four and by 16 with respect to other
	architectures (low-power utilization)},

	parallel code generation, is a challenging problem. We present a
	procedure for automatic parallel code generation in the case of algorithms
	described through a SARE (Set of Affine Recurrence Equations). Starting
	from the original SARE description in an N-dimensional iteration
	space, the algorithm is converted into a parallel code for an (eventually
	virtual) m-dimensional distributed memory parallel machine (m<N).
	We demonstrate some theorems which are the mathematical basis for
	the proposed parallel generation tool. The projection technique used
	in the tool is based on the polytope model. Some affine transformations
	are introduced to project the polytope from the original iteration
	space onto another polytope, preserving the SARE semantic, in the
	time-processor (t,p) space. Points in (t,p) are individuated through
	the m-dimensional p coordinate and the n-dimensional t coordinate,
	resulting in N=n+m. Along with polytope transformation, a methodology
	to generate the code within processors is given. Finally, a cost
	function, used to guide the heuristic search for the polytope transformation
	and derived from the actual implementation of the method on an MPP
	SIMD machine, is introduced},

	Starting at the application level, there is a need for programming
	models and communications APIs that allow applications to be easily
	re-configured for many different possible architectures without tedious
	rewriting, while at the same time ensuring efficient production code.
	Synchronisation and control of task scheduling may be provided by
	RTOS's or other scheduling methods, and the choice of programming
	and threading models, whether symmetric or asymmetric, has a heavy
	influence on how best to control task or thread execution. Debugging
	MP systems for the typical application developer becomes a much more
	complex job, when compared to traditional single-processor debug,
	or the debug of simple MP systems that are only very loosely coupled.
	The interaction between the system, applications and software views,
	and processor configuration and extension, adds a new dimension to
	the problem space. Zeroing in on the optimal solution for a particular
	MPSoC design demands a multi-disciplinary approach. After reviewing
	the design challenges, we end by focusing on the requirements for
	design tools that may ameliorate many of these issues, and illustrate
	some of the possible solutions, based on experiments.},

	r rate than main memory, relative latencies from processors to main
	memory have dramatically increased. Main memory laten- ties can reach
	tens of processor cycles in uniprocessors and over a hundred cycles
	in multiprocessors. These figures are likely to grow even larger
	over the next decade, and systems architects have responded by adding
	one or more levels of cache into memory hierarchies between the processo
	r and main memory. Even with these hierarchies, however, many programs
	still have poor memory performance if cache misses are common. To
	improve program memory performance, programmers and compiler writers
	can transform the application so that its memory-referenc- ing behavior
	better exploits the memory hierarchy. The challenge in achieving
	these program transformations is overcoming the difficulty of statically
	analyzing or reasoning about an application s referencing behavior
	and interactions. In addition, many performance-monitoring tools
	collect high-level information that is inadequately detailed to analyze
	specific memory performance bugs. Here we describe MemSpy, a performance
	-monitoring tool we designed to help programmers discern where and
	why memory bottlenecks occur. MemSpy guides programmers toward program
	transformati ons that improve memory performance through detailed
	statistics on cache-mis s causes and frequency. Because of the natural
	link between data-reference patterns and memory performance, MemSpy
	helps programmers comprehend data structure and code segment interactions
	by displaying statistics in terms of both the program s data and
	code structures, rather than for code structures alone. MemSpy uses
	cache simulations to gather detailed memory statistics.},

	than memory speed. Small, fast cache memories are designed to overcome
	this discrepancy, but they are only effective when programs exhibit
	data locality. In the this article, we present compiler optimizations
	to improve data locality based on a simple yet accurate cost model.
	The model computes both temporal and spatial reuse of cache lines
	to find desirable loop organizations. The cost model drives the application
	of compound transformations consisting of loop permutation, loop
	fusion, loop distribution, and loop reversal. To validate our optimization
	strategy, we implemented our algorithms and ran experiments on a
	large collection of scientific programs and kernels. Experiments
	illustrate that for kernels our model and algorithm can select and
	achieve the best loop structure for a nest. For over 30 complete
	applications, we executed the original and transformed versions and
	simulated cache hit rates. We collected statistics about the inherent
	characteristics of these programs and our ability to improve their
	data locality. To our knowledge, these studies are the first of such
	breadth and depth. We found performance improvements were difficult
	to achieve bacause benchmark programs typically have high hit rates
	even for small data caches; however, our optimizations significanty
	improved several programs.},

	In this paper we extend an automated method for detecting and exploiting

	of the generated reuse buffers has to change during loop execution
	according to the varying reuse distance. We make use of the polyhedral

	easy.
	
	Our software complements the existing HLS design flows. Starting from
	a loop nest written in C, our tool generates the RTL design of a
	data reuse buffer tailored for the application and a loop controller
	that streamlines reuse buffer operations with loop body execution,
	and prepares the loop body for synthesis by an external HLS tool.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary development of reconfigurable logic devices has seen
	a gradual drift from fine-grain to coarser-grain architectures, but
	this remained firmly grounded on their processing capabilities. These
	improvements have unfortunately not been accompanied by similar advancements
	in support for data-flow. Although embedded memory blocks have been
	added and routing resources improved, data-flow remains the bottleneck
	in most implementations, particularly for DSP applications.
	
	This research aims at improving an application?s data-flow implementation
	by presenting memory design abstractions for structured data access.
	These abstractions can then either be mapped to a dedicated address
	generation unit, or be offered as a library of address generation
	modules for platform-independent optimised synthesis. Besides requiring
	fewer routing resources, the dedicated implementation exhibits an
	additional benefit towards area (up to 18 times) and performance
	(up to 2.6 times).
	
	The benefit of reconfigurable logic devices over digital signal processors
	is mostly related to their potential for more parallelism. Since
	memory blocks in reconfigurable platforms are generally smaller than
	in DSP processors, the scalability of this memory with localised
	address generation is studied. Different memory partitioning schemes
	for improved concurrent accesses are investigated in detail. Design
	exploration for a 2D filter indicates area and performance variations
	up to 55 and 2.7 times, respectively. Some model applications are
	used to demonstrate the memory architecture design space. The implementations
	are investigated with respect to the on-chip buffer size, the potential
	parallelism and possibility of appending new data during processing.
	
	The presented work indicates the benefits of dedicated address generation
	and memory design abstractions to improve the data-flow implementation
	on reconfigurable devices. The approach is scalable, eases the design
	process and can be applied to a large set of applications.},

  abstract = {The semiconductor industry roadmap projects that advances in VLSI
	technology will permit more than one billion transistors on a chip
	by the year 2010. The MIT Raw microprocessor is a proposed architecture
	that strives to exploit these chip-level resources by implementing
	thousands of tiles, each comprising a processing element and a small
	amount of memory, coupled by a static two-dimensional interconnect.
	A compiler partitions fine-grain instruction-level parallelism across
	the tiles and statically schedules intertile communication over the
	interconnect. Because Raw microprocessors fully expose their internal
	hardware structure to the software, they can be viewed as a gigantic
	FPGA with coarse-grained tiles in which software orchestrates communication
	over static interconnections. One open challenge in Raw architectures
	is to determine their optimal grain size and balance. The grain size
	is the area of each tile and the balance is the proportion of area
	in each tile devoted to memory, processing, communication, and off-chip
	global I/O. If the total chip area is fixed, higher processing power
	per tile requires large tiles and hence reduces the total number
	of tiles on the chip. This paper presents SimpleFit, a novel analytical
	framework that designers can use to reason about the design space
	of Raw microprocessors. Our model is also generalizable to multiprocessors
	on a chip. Based on an architectural model, an application model,
	and a VLSI cost analysis, the framework computes the performance
	of applications and uses an optimization process to identify designs
	that will execute these applications most cost-effectively. Although
	the optimal machine configurations obtained vary for different applications,
	problem sizes, and budgets, the general trends for various applications
	are similar. Accordingly, for the applications studied, assuming
	a onr billion logic transistor equivalent area, we recommend building
	a Raw chip with approximately 1,000 tiles, 30 words/cycle global
	I/O, 20 Kbytes of local memory per tile, three to four words/cycle
	local communication bandwidth, and single-issue processors. This
	configuration will give performance near the global optimum for most

  abstract = {CMPs have now become mainstream and are growing in complexity with
	more cores, several shared resources (cache, memory, etc) and the
	potential for additional heterogeneous elements. In order to manage
	these resources, it is becoming critical to optimize the interaction
	between the execution environment (operating systems, virtual machine
	monitors, etc) and the CMP platform. Performance analysis of such
	OS and CMP interactions is challenging because it requires long running
	full-system execution-driven simulations. In this paper, we explore
	an alternative approach (CMPSched$im) to evaluate the interaction
	of OS and CMP architectures. In particular, CMPSched$im is focused
	on evaluating techniques to address the shared cache management problem
	through better interaction between CMP hardware and operating system
	scheduling. CMPSched$im enables fast and flexible exploration of
	this interaction by combining the benefits of (a) binary instrumentation
	tools (Pin), (b) user-level scheduling tools (Linsched) and (c) simple
	core/cache simulators. In this paper, we describe CMPSched$im in
	detail and present case studies showing how CMPSched$im can be used
	to optimize OS scheduling by taking advantage of novel shared cache
	monitoring capabilities in the hardware. We also describe OS scheduling
	heuristics to improve overall system performance through resource
	monitoring and application classification to achieve near optimal

	Dataflow},
  school = {University of California at Berkeley},
  year = {1996},
  month = {December},
  note = {Professor Edward A. Lee, Chair},
  abstract = {In this thesis, we present various scheduling techniques for programs
	expressed as Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) and Multidimensional Synchronous
	dataflow graphs. Synchronous dataflow has proven efficient as a specification
	model for block-diagram based programming environments for signal
	processing. Two key reasons for its popularity are that a) static
	schedules can be constructed at compile time, thus eliminating the
	overhead due to dynamic scheduling, and b) it models multirate signal
	processing application very naturally and intuitively. The first
	property is particularly important in environments where code-synthesis
	for embedded processors is desirable, since embedded signal processing
	applications have rigid throughput requirements in order to meet
	hardreal- time constraints. Multidimensional Synchronous Dataflow
	(MDSDF) is an extension of SDF to multiple dimensions; in this model,
	applications such as image and video signal processing, which operate
	on multidimensional signal spaces, are more naturally modeled and
	specified than in SDF. The amount of on-chip memory available on
	embedded processors is often severely limited. Adding off-chip memory
	is usually not an option because it entails a speed penalty, it increases
	overall system cost and size, and increases power requirements. Thus,
	when generating software implementations from SDF specifications
	for a uniprocessor, the scheduling problem of minimizing code size
	and buffer memory size becomes crucial. If the scheduling is not
	done carefully, the blowup in the size of the implementation can
	preclude implementation on the processor. Previous techniques have
	focused on scheduling to minimize code size. However, this neglected
	the buffer memory usage of the schedule; in this thesis, we develop
	techniques that jointly minimize for code size and buffer-memory
	size of the software implementation. We give three polynomial-time
	algorithms: a dynamic programming algorithm that is used as a post-optimization
	step, and two heuristics that use different approaches to constructing
	these schedules. The general problem is shown to be NP-complete,
	thus justifying the use of heuristics. An extensive experimental
	study is given to show the efficacy of all these techniques. We extend
	these scheduling results to MDSDF specifications. We then tackle
	a problem of a different type. A multidimensional signal can be sampled
	in many different ways. A straightforward extension of one-dimensional
	sampling results in the so-called rectangular sampling structure,
	where the samples lie on a rectangular grid. However, a more general
	sampling structure is a geometrical lattice; sampling lattices that
	are not rectangular can have many advantages in certain applications.
	For example, a signal sampled on a non-rectangular lattice can have
	a lower sampling density than one sampled on an equivalent rectangular
	lattice. For real-time processing of multidimensional signals, a
	lower sampling density means fewer samples to process in a given
	time interval. The standard MDSDF model suffers from the inability
	to model multidimensional systems sampled on arbitrary sampling lattices;
	hence, we give an extension of MDSDF that is capable of modeling
	such systems. The model we give preserves the property of static,
	compile-time schedulability. However, constructing such schedules
	requires the solution to some challenging problems. In particular,
	we show that an augmented set of balance equations have to be solved
	simultaneously in the extended model. The additional equations are
	quite different from the usual balance equations in SDF and MDSDF;
	they involve computing so-called integer volumes of parallelepipeds.
	This computation turns out to be an interesting number-theoretic
	problem, and we present several approaches for solving it. Finally,
	we present a practical example of a video sampling structure conversion
	system to show the usefulness of the generalized MDSDF model.},

  abstract = {Signal flow graphs with dataflow semantics have been used in signal
	processing system simulation, algorithm development, and real-time
	system design. Dataflow semantics implicitly expose function parallelism
	by imposing only a partial ordering constraint on the execution of
	functions. One particular form of dataflow called synchronous dataflow
	(SDF) has been quite popular in programming environments for digital
	signal processing (DSP) since it has strong formal properties and
	is ideally suited for expressing multirate DSP algorithms. However,
	SDF and other dataflow models use first-in first-out (FIFO) queues
	on the communication channels and are thus ideally suited only for
	one-dimensional (1-D) signal processing algorithms. While multidimensional
	systems can also be expressed by collapsing arrays into 1-D streams,
	such modeling is often awkward and can obscure potential data parallelism
	that might be present. SDF can be generalized to multiple dimensions;
	this model is called multidimensional synchronous dataflow (MDSDF).
	This paper presents MDSDF and shows how MDSDF can be efficiently
	used to model a variety of multidimensional DSP systems, as well
	as other types of systems that are not modeled elegantly in SDF.
	However, MDSDF generalizes the FIFO queues used in SDF to arrays
	and, thus, is capable only of expressing systems sampled on rectangular
	lattices. This paper also presents a generalization of MDSDF that
	is capable of handling arbitrary sampling lattices and lattice-changing
	operations such as nonrectangular decimation and interpolation. An
	example of a practical system is given to show the usefulness of
	this model. The key challenge in generalizing the MDSDF model is
	preserving static schedulability, which eliminates the overhead associated
	with dynamic scheduling, and preserving a model where data parallelism,
	as well as functional parallelism, is fully explicit},

  abstract = {Recent advances in VLSI technology have given a tremendous boost to
	both the size and speed of circuits that can be mapped onto FPGA.
	This has opened up a huge range of potential applications for FPGAs
	at a time when the doubling in of the CPU speed every two years,
	made possible by Moore's Law, seems very unlikely. This has in turn
	infused a new life in the area of reconfigurable computing where
	a computation is expressed as a circuit through which data is streamed
	rather than a sequence of instructions operating on a fixed data-path.
	In this model the circuit is reconfigured, at times dynamically,
	to conform to the computation at hand. Numerous studies have demonstrated
	speed-ups using this technology that have varied from 10x to 10,000x
	on a wide spectrum of applications.
	
	The programmability problem is two-fold (1) programming the FPGA requires
	low-level knowledge not normally known by application designers,
	(2) and the applications themselves are typically highly tuned to
	a software execution. The task of transforming temporal code, intended
	to be run on a microprocessor, into spatial code that best takes
	advantage of reconfigurable hardware is non-trivial and a hardware
	compiler may not perform the proper set of transformations to generate
	efficient hardware. Configuring the software so that the optimal
	hardware is generated may require extensive transformation to both
	the application and the compiler.
	
	To address these issues, as well as provide an open source platform
	for further growth, we introduce the second generation of the Riverside
	Optimizing Compiler for Configurable Computing (ROCCC 2.0). ROCCC
	2.0 is a compiler that transforms modules and systems written in
	C into synthesizable VHDL. Modules are written in a subset of C and
	transformed into parallel, pipelined VHDL. Modules compiled by ROCCC
	are then exported back to the user and may be used to build up larger
	modules and complete systems that interface with memory through user
	specified channels. The main features of ROCCC 2.0 are:
	
	a. Modular (LEGO-like) code design supporting code re-use and compiler
	generated modular redundancy for increased reliability.
	
	b. Separation of user application code from the interface to external
	devices.
	
	c. Allows the import of hard or soft IP cores into modules written
	in C code.
	
	Including a hardware module in C code is accomplished by calling the
	exported C function with no special syntax, resulting in the generation
	of hardware that includes the module directly in the pipeline where
	necessary. This allows for the creation of hardware systems from
	the bottom-up while retaining the extensive parallelizing optimizations
	performed by ROCCC 1.0. Approaching the creation of hardware accelerators
	in this manner gives designers the control necessary to identify
	and create systems appropriate for hardware directly in C. In this
	tutorial we discuss the details of programming for and implementing
	ROCCC, features currently in development including support for redundancy,
	as well as examples of ROCCC compilation.},

	are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino

	by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain

  number = {1},
  abstract = {Chip multiprocessors - also called multi-core microprocessors or CMPs
	for short - are now the only way to build high-performance microprocessors,
	for a variety of reasons. Large uniprocessors are no longer scaling
	in performance, because it is only possible to extract a limited
	amount of parallelism from a typical instruction stream using conventional
	superscalar instruction issue techniques. In addition, one cannot
	simply ratchet up the clock speed on today's processors, or the power
	dissipation will become prohibitive in all but water-cooled systems.
	Compounding these problems is the simple fact that with the immense
	numbers of transistors available on today's microprocessor chips,
	it is too costly to design and debug ever-larger processors every
	year or two. 
	
	CMPs avoid these problems by filling up a processor die with multiple,
	relatively simpler processor cores instead of just one huge core.
	The exact size of a CMPs cores can vary from very simple pipelines
	to moderately complex superscalar processors, but once a core has
	been selected the CMPs performance can easily scale across silicon
	process generations simply by stamping down more copies of the hard-to-design,
	high-speed processor core in each successive chip generation. In
	addition, parallel code execution, obtained by spreading multiple
	threads of execution across the various cores, can achieve significantly
	higher performance than would be possible using only a single core.
	While parallel threads are already common in many useful workloads,
	there are still important workloads that are hard to divide into
	parallel threads. The low inter-processor communication latency between
	the cores in a CMP helps make a much wider range of applications
	viable candidates for parallel execution than was possible with conventional,
	multi-chip multiprocessors; nevertheless, limited parallelism in
	key applications is the main factor limiting acceptance of CMPs in
	some types of systems. 
	
	After a discussion of the basic pros and cons of CMPs when they are
	compared with conventional uniprocessors, this book examines how
	CMPs can best be designed to handle two radically different kinds
	of workloads that are likely to be used with a CMP: highly parallel,
	throughput-sensitive applications at one end of the spectrum, and
	less parallel, latency-sensitive applications at the other. Throughput-sensitive
	applications, such as server workloads that handle many independent
	transactions at once, require careful balancing of all parts of a
	CMP that can limit throughput, such as the individual cores, on-chip
	cache memory, and off-chip memory interfaces. Several studies and
	example systems, such as the Sun Niagara, that examine the necessary
	tradeoffs are presented here. In contrast, latency-sensitive applications
	many desktop applications fall into this category require a focus
	on reducing inter-core communication latency and applying techniques
	to help programmers divide their programs into multiple threads as
	easily as possible. This book discusses many techniques that can
	be used in CMPs to simplify parallel programming, with an emphasis
	on research directions proposed at Stanford University. To illustrate
	the advantages possible with a CMP using a couple of solid examples,
	extra focus is given to thread-level speculation (TLS), a way to
	automatically break up nominally sequential applications into parallel
	threads on a CMP, and transactional memory. This model can greatly
	simplify manual parallel programming by using hardware instead of
	conventional software locks to enforce atomic code execution of blocks
	of instructions, a technique that makes parallel coding much less
	error-prone.},

	support vendor-specific memory interfaces, and in particular do not
	provide direct support for pipelined access modes, increasing the
	complexity and the burden on designers in the mapping of applications
	to FPGA-based computing engines. In this paper we address the problem
	of memory access interfacing and aggressive scheduling of memory
	accesses by proposing a decoupled architecture with two components
	- one component captures the specific target architecture timing
	while the other component uses application specific memory access
	pattern information. The results presented in this paper support
	the claim that it is possible to exploit application specific information
	and integrate that knowledge in a custom schedulers that mix pipelined
	access modes and non-pipelined access modes for reducing the overhead
	associated with memory accesses. The results also reveal that the
	additional design complexity of the scheduler, and its impact in
	the overall design is minimal.},

  abstract = {The {Java} Programming Language has been praised for its platform
	independence and portability, but because of its slow execution speed
	on a software {Java} Virtual Machine (JVM), some people decide to
	use faster languages such as C. Building a JVM in hardware is an
	obvious solution to this problem. Several approaches have been taken
	to try to achieve the best solution. One approach is by reducing
	the number of {Java} instructions a program has to execute along
	with directly executing instructions in hardware, for example on
	a Field Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA}), to increase the execution
	speed. Another approach is the translation of {Java} Byte Codes into
	native code by a {FPGA} and then executing the native code on a conventional
	CPU. Others have developed a multithreaded JVM and exploited the
	parallelism offered by a {FPGA} and have specifically designed the
	JVM for real-time systems. This paper compares and contrasts all
	these approaches and then argues that the parallelism of a {FPGA}
	should be exploited in the most general way possible by not restricting
	the threads of execution to a specific task. It gives a method for
	building such a JVM and also some results from a JVM that was built
	using this method. The paper concludes that this approach should
	be taken to build a system that is capable of running threads of
	a {Java} program in parallel.},

  abstract = {Until very recently, microprocessor designs were computation-centric.
	On-chip communication was frequently ignored. This was because of
	fast, single-cycle on-chip communication. The interconnect power
	was also insignificant compared to the transistor power. With uniprocessor
	designs providing diminishing returns and the advent of chip multiprocessors
	(CMPs) in mainstream systems, the on-chip network that connects different
	processing cores has become a critical part of the design. Transistor
	miniaturization has led to high global wire delay, and interconnect
	power comparable to transistor power. CMP design proposals can no
	longer ignore the interaction between the memory hierarchy and the
	interconnection network that connects various elements. This necessitates
	a detailed and accurate interconnection network model within a full-system
	evaluation framework. Ignoring the interconnect details might lead
	to inaccurate results when simulating a CMP architecture. It also
	becomes important to analyze the impact of interconnection network
	optimization techniques on full system behavior. In this light, we
	developed a detailed cycle-accurate interconnection network model
	(GARNET), inside the GEMS full-system simulation framework. GARNET
	models a classic five-stage pipelined router with virtual channel
	(VC) flow control. Microarchitectural details, such as flit-level
	input buffers, routing logic, allocators and the crossbar switch,
	are modeled. GARNET, along with GEMS, provides a detailed and accurate
	memory system timing model. To demonstrate the importance and potential
	impact of GARNET, we evaluate a shared and private L2 CMP with a
	realistic state-of-the-art interconnection network against the original
	GEMS simple network. The objective of the evaluation was to figure
	out which configuration is better for a particular workload. We show
	that not modeling the interconnect in detail might lead to an incorrect
	outcome. We also evaluate Express Virtual Channels (EVCs), an on-chip
	network flow control proposal, in a full-system fashion. We show
	that in improving on-chip network latency-throughput, EVCs do lead
	to better overall system runtime, however, the impact varies widely
	across applications.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that over 90% of all new information produced in the
	world is being stored on magnetic media, most of it in hard disk
	drives. Despite their importance, there is relatively little published
	work on the failure patterns of disk drives, and the key factors
	that affect their lifetime. Most available data are either based
	on extrapolation from accelerated aging experiments or from relatively
	modest sized field studies. Moreover, larger population studies rarely
	have the infrastructure in place to collect health signals from components
	in operation, which is critical information for detailed failure
	analysis.
	
	
	We present data collected from detailed observations of a large disk
	drive population in a production Internet services deployment. The
	population observed is many times larger than that of previous studies.
	In addition to presenting failure statistics, we analyze the correlation
	between failures and several parameters generally believed to impact
	longevity.
	
	
	Our analysis identifies several parameters from the drive?s self
	monitoring facility (SMART) that correlate highly with failures.
	Despite this high correlation, we conclude that models based on SMART
	parameters alone are unlikely to be useful for predicting individual
	drive failures. Surprisingly, we found that temperature and activity
	levels were much less correlated with drive failures than previously
	reported.},

  title = {Program Transformations and Memory Architecture Optimizations for
	High-Level Synthesis of Hardware Accelerators},
  school = {Universit?de Lyon},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {A wide category of sold products including telecommunication and multimedia
	propose more and more advanced features and functionalities. These
	functionalities come at a cost of increased design complexity. For
	performance and power budget issues, these features can be accelerated
	using dedicated hardware accelerators. To meet the required time-to-market
	and development price, traditional hardware design methodologies
	are not suffcient and the use of high-level synthesis (HLS) tools
	is an appealing alternative. These tools are now getting more mature
	for generating hardware accelerators with an optimized internal structure,
	thanks to effcient scheduling techniques, resource sharing, and finite-state
	machines generation. However, interfacing them with the outside world,
	i.e., integrating the automatically-generated hardware accelerators
	within the complete design, with optimized communications, so that
	they achieve the best throughput, remains a very hard task, reserved
	to expert designers. The leitmotiv of this thesis was to study and
	to develop source-to-source strategies to improve the design of these
	interfaces, trying to consider the HLS tool as a back-end for more
	advanced front-end transformations.
	
	In the first part of the thesis, as a case study, we designed by hand,
	in VHDL, an intelligent glue logic to interface an accelerator, for
	matrix-matrix multiplication, generated by the MMAlpha HLS tool.
	Using data dependence information, we implemented double-buffering
	and blocking techniques on a scratchpad-like local SRAM memory to
	exploit data reuse. This increased significantly the performance
	of the system but required also a significant engineering effort.
	We then showed, on several multi-media applications and with another
	HLS tool, Spark, that the same benefit could be obtained with a preliminary
	semi-automatic source-to-source (here C-to-C) transformations step.
	For that, we used an advanced state-of-the-art compiler front-end,
	based on the Open64 compiler and the WRaP-IT framework for polyhedral
	transformations. Significant improvements were shown in particular
	on the synthesis of part of the video color space conversion from
	MediaBench II benchmarks, for which data was fed through a processor
	cache memory. This study demonstrated the importance of loop transformations
	as a pre-processing step to HLS tools, but also the difficulty to
	use them depending on the HLS tool features to express external communications.
	
	In the second part of the thesis, using the C2H HLS tool from Altera,
	which can synthesize hardware accelerators communicating to an external
	DDR-SDRAM memory, we showed that it is possible to automatically
	restructure the application code, to generate adequate communication
	processes in C, and to compile them all with C2H, so that the resulting
	application is highly-optimized, with full usage of the memory bandwidth.
	These transformations and optimizations, which combine techniques
	such as double buffering, array contraction, loop tiling, software
	pipelining, among others, were incorporated in an automatic source-to-source
	transformation tool, called Chuba, based
	
	on the polyhedral model representation. Our study shows that high-level
	synthesis (HLS) tools can indeed be used as back-end optimizers for
	front-end optimizations, as it is the case for standard compilation
	with high-level transformations developed on top of assembly-code
	optimizers. We believe this is the way to go for making HLS tools
	viable.},

	a scheduling method based on the algorithms from [Fea92a, Fea92b]

	for automatically parallelizing computations that manipulate dynamic,

	at this granularity to discover when operations commute (i.e., generate
	the same final result regardless of the order in which they execute).
	If all of the operations required to perform a given computation
	commute, the compiler can automatically generate parallel code. We
	have implemented a prototype compilation system that uses commutativity
	analysis as its primary analysis technique. We have used this system
	to automatically parallelize three complete scientific computations:
	the Barnes-Hut N-body solver, the Water liquid simulation code, and
	the String seismic simulation code. This article presents performance
	results for the generated parallel code running on the Stanford DASH
	machine. These results provide encouraging evidence that commutativity

	of a set of guarded atomic actions by Hoe and Arvind to modules of

	constraints on the interface methods of the called modules, derives
	the "glue logic" and the scheduling constraints for the interface
	methods of the calling module such that the atomicity of the guarded
	actions is preserved across module boundaries. Such modules provide
	reusable IP which facilitates "correctness by construction" design
	methodology. It also reduces compile-times dramatically in comparison

	to the hardware-generated thread-based prefetching technique and
	can decouple the performance and correctness to some extent. This
	paper describes the necessary hardware infrastructure supporting
	Dynamic Prefetching Thread on traditional Chip Multiprocessors. Aiming
	at the loosely coupled feature of Chip Multiprocessors, we present
	the ?Shadow Register? mechanism to support rapid register transportation
	among multi-cores and discuss the selection of thread spawn time.
	Furthermore, two aggressive thread construction policies, known as
	?Self-Loop? and ?Fork-on-Recursive-Call?, are proposed. ?Self-Loop?
	policy can greatly enlarge the prefetching range and issue more timely
	prefetches. ?Fork-on-Recursive-Call? policy can eVectively accelerate
	applications accessing trees or graphs via recursive calls. For a
	set of memory limited benchmarks selected from Olden benchmark, SPEC
	CPU2000 as well as Stream benchmark, an average speedup of 3.8% is
	achieved on dual-core CMP when constructing basic Dynamic Prefetching
	Threads, and this gain grows to 29.6% when adopting our aggressive

  title = {Profile-Driven Discovery of Parallelism for Multi-Core Processors},
  school = {Ghent University},
  year = {2010},
  note = {{ISBN}~978-90-8578-376-3},
  abstract = {In the past multi-processors were computers that contained multiple
	processors on one motherboard or distributed computers that communicated
	with each other over the network. Those systems were rather costly
	and as a consequence mainly used for special purposes (such as scientific
	and military research). However, thanks to advancing technology we
	are able to put more and more functionality on a single chip for
	the same price. Hereby it became possible to put multiple processor
	cores on a single chip, the so-called Chip Multi-Processor (CMP).
	This recent rise of the CMP leads us today to a world where practically
	all electronic devices contain parallel processor cores. These devices
	range from embedded systems, such as mobile phones, up to computers
	for both personal and professional use. Hence, multi-processors are
	no longer reserved for a select public, but have become a commodity.
	
	Of course these parallel cores can only be fully utilized if the programs
	provide them with parallel work. This requires so-called multithreaded
	programs, programs that spawn multiple threads that all perform their
	own independent calculations. However, when creating multi-threaded
	programs one has to proceed with caution when using shared data structures.
	If multiple threads modify the same data structure, this results
	into conflicts. In the past, several techniques demonstrated that
	for a select group of programs (mainly scientific programs) the parallelism
	can be extracted automatically by compilers. For the vast majority
	of more general-purpose programs these techniques appear to fail
	and is the programmer left on his/her own for explicitly identifying
	and implementing the parallelism. In this thesis we introduce a framework
	that, based on profiling information, makes it possible to automatically
	detect parallelism in more programs, where formerly the only option
	was manual parallelization.
	
	\textbf{Detection of pipeline parallelism}{\quad}Static analysis can
	assume dependencies that in reality never occur, due to insufficient
	information for the analysis. These false dependencies can obstruct
	the available parallelism. For this reason we use a profile-based
	approach. During an initial program execution it collects all dynamic
	data dependencies and the control flow. For this we keep a record
	of who writes or reads a data structure. Moreover, in the case of
	nested loops we keep track of which loop levels carried the dependency.
	
	We use this profiling information to detect pipeline parallelism in
	the outer program loops of several MiBench and SPECint2000 programs.
	Our evaluation shows that for several programs our framework is able
	to detect more parallelism than existing techniques. Moreover, after
	verification the detected parallelism also proves to be correct.
	This indicates that for coarse-grain parallelism the data dependencies
	on the level of the outer loops are rarely dependent on the program
	input.
	
	\textbf{Using accelerators}{\quad}Besides general-purpose processor
	cores, current computers also contain specialized processor cores,
	so-called accelerators. These can be on the same die as the main
	processor (for example in the Cell BE processor) or on a separate
	board (for example a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)). In order to
	use an accelerator there are two important aspects: on the one hand
	the identification of a piece of suitable program code that can be
	offloaded to the accelerator and on the other hand the implementation
	that takes the specific features of the accelerator into account.
	
	In this dissertation we propose a new technique for the identification
	of accelerator code that goes beyond merely searching for the hottest
	code. For this we introduce three heuristics to identify interesting
	sub-algorithms. These sub-algorithms are program parts that can easily
	be separated from the rest of the program. The first heuristic takes
	the amount of private data into account. Since accelerators typically
	have a limited amount of private data, this heuristic can help with
	selecting the most suitable sub-algorithm for an accelerator. The
	second heuristic looks at the amount of data shared between the subalgorithm
	and the rest of the program. This heuristics takes the communication
	overhead into account between the main processor and the accelerator.
	The third heuristic looks at the amount of average data traffic between
	the main processor and the accelerator. With this heuristic we can
	take the bandwidth restrictions into account. Our evaluation shows
	that with the help of these three heuristics we are able to
	
	\textbf{Improving automatic parallelization}{\quad}The last contribution
	of the dissertation is to identify some of the underlying reasons
	that prevent static analysis to detect parallelism. We also provide
	the necessary solutions to prevent these causes and as such improve
	automatic parallelization. In some cases parallelism in a loop is
	obstructed by a few code fragments that require to be executed in
	the original program order. We propose a technique that allows to
	postpone the execution of these socalled ordered sections by a simple
	code transformation. This exposes more opportunities to find parallelism.
	
	The static analysis has also many difficulties with analysis of pointers
	(references to memory) and the reuse of data structures. For this
	we introduce a light-weight programming model that uses a few of
	annotations that provide the static analysis with extra semantic
	information that can help in finding more parallelism. This approach
	is an implicit programming model since the annotations do not express
	explicit parallelism. For the placement of some of the annotations
	we can use our profiling information again. Moreover, the annotations
	are selected in such a way that their correctness can easily be checked.
	The evaluation shows that several programs that cannot be parallelized
	by the latest state-of-the art auto parallelization compilers, can
	actually be automatically parallelized with our technique.},

  abstract = {With the rise of Chip multiprocessors (CMPs), the amount of parallel
	computing power will increase significantly in the near future. However,
	most programs are sequential in nature and have not been explicitly
	parallelized, so they cannot exploit these parallel resources. Automatic
	parallelization of sequential, non-regular codes is very hard, as
	illustrated by the lack of solutions after more than 30 years of
	research on the topic. The question remains if there is parallelism
	in sequential programs that can be detected automatically and if
	so, how much parallelism there is. .
	
	In this paper, we propose a framework for extracting potential parallelism
	from programs. Applying this framework to sequential programs can
	teach us how much parallelism is present in a program, but also tells
	us what the most appropriate parallel construct for a program is,
	e.g. a pipeline, master/slave work distribution, etc. 
	
	Our framework is profile-based, implying that it is not safe. It builds
	two new graph representations of the profile-data: the interprocedural
	data flow graph and the data sharing graph. This graphs show the
	data-flow between functions and the data structures facilitating
	this data-flow, respectively. We apply our framework on the SPECcpu2000
	bzip2 benchmark, achieving a speedup of 3.74 of the compression part
	and a global speedup of 2.45 on a quad processor system.},

	as commodity data-parallel coprocessors. The newest generations of
	GPU architecture %, such as the NVIDIA GeForce 8-series, provide
	easier programmability and increased generality while maintaining
	the tremendous memory bandwidth and computational power of traditional
	GPUs. This opportunity should redirect efforts in GPGPU research
	from ad hoc porting of applications to establishing principles and
	strategies that allow efficient mapping of computation to graphics
	hardware. In this work we discuss the GeForce 8800 GTX processor's
	organization, features, and generalized optimization strategies.
	Key to performance on this platform is using massive multithreading
	to utilize the large number of cores and hide global memory latency.
	To achieve this, developers face the challenge of striking the right
	balance between each thread's resource usage and the number of simultaneously
	active threads. The resources to manage include the number of registers
	and the amount of on-chip memory used per thread, number of threads
	per multiprocessor, and global memory bandwidth. We also obtain increased
	performance by reordering accesses to off-chip memory to combine
	requests to the same or contiguous memory locations and apply classical
	optimizations to reduce the number of executed operations. We apply
	these strategies across a variety of applications and domains and
	achieve between a 10.5X to 457X speedup in kernel codes and between
	1.16X to 431X total application speedup.},

  abstract = {In the "Terabus" optical interconnect program, optical data bus technologies
	are developed that will support terabit/second chip-to-chip data
	transfers over organic cards within high-performance servers, switch
	routers, and other intensive computing systems. A complete technology
	set is developed for this purpose, based on a chip-like optoelectronic
	packaging structure (Optochip), assembled directly onto an organic
	card (Optocard). Vertical-cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and
	photodiode arrays (4$,times,$12) are flip-chip bonded to the driver
	and receiver IC arrays implemented in 0.13-$mu$m CMOS. The IC arrays
	are in turn flip-chip assembled onto a 1.2-cm$^2$silicon carrier
	interposer to complete the transmitter and receiver Optochips. The
	organic Optocard incorporates 48 parallel multimode optical waveguides
	on a 62.5-$mu$m pitch. A simple scheme for optical coupling between
	the Optochip and the Optocard is developed, based on a single-lens
	array etched onto the backside of the optoelectronic arrays and on
	45$^circ$mirrors in the waveguides. Transmitter and receiver operation

	tool that is a part of the full PICO system, identifies within the
	application a loop nest to be implemented as an NPA, and indicates
	the performance required of the NPA by specifying the number of processors

	The main objective of PICO-NPA is to reduce design cost and time,

  abstract = {Errors in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) are a common form of
	hardware failure in modern compute clusters. Failures are costly
	both in terms of hardware replacement costs and service disruption.
	While a large body of work exists on DRAM in laboratory conditions,
	little has been reported on real DRAM failures in large production
	clusters. In this paper, we analyze measurements of memory errors
	in a large fleet of commodity servers over a period of 2.5 years.
	The collected data covers multiple vendors, DRAM capacities and technologies,
	and comprises many millions of DIMM days.
	
	
	The goal of this paper is to answer questions such as the following:
	How common are memory errors in practice? What are their statistical
	properties? How are they affected by external factors, such as temperature
	and utilization, and by chip-specific factors, such as chip density,
	memory technology and DIMM age?
	
	
	We find that DRAM error behavior in the field differs in many key
	aspects from commonly held assumptions. For example, we observe DRAM
	error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than previously reported,
	with 25,000 to 70,000 errors per billion device hours per Mbit and
	more than 8% of DIMMs affected by errors per year. We provide strong
	evidence that memory errors are dominated by hard errors, rather
	than soft errors, which previous work suspects to be the dominant
	error mode. We find that temperature, known to strongly impact DIMM
	error rates in lab conditions, has a surprisingly small effect on
	error behavior in the field, when taking all other factors into account.
	Finally, unlike commonly feared, we don't observe any indication
	that newer generations of DIMMs have worse error behavior.},

	video compression standards, in particular JPEG2000. A 2D DWT consists
	of horizontal filtering along the rows followed by vertical filtering
	along the columns. It is well-known that a straightforward implementation
	of vertical filtering (assuming a row-major layout) induces many
	cache misses, due to lack of spatial locality. This can be avoided
	by interchanging the loops. This paper shows, however, that the resulting
	implementation suffers significantly from 64K aliasing, which occurs
	in the Pentium 4 when two data blocks are accessed that are a multiple
	of 64K apart, and we propose two techniques to avoid it. In addition,
	if the filter length is longer than four, the number of ways of the
	L1 data cache of the Pentium 4 is insufficient to avoid cache conflict
	misses. Consequently, we propose two methods for reducing conflict
	misses. Although experimental results have been collected on the
	Pentium 4, the techniques are general and can be applied to other
	processors with different cache organizations as well. The proposed
	techniques improve the performance of vertical filtering compared
	to already optimized baseline implementations by a factor of 3.11
	for the (5,3) lifting scheme, 3.11 for Daubechies' transform of four

	prior research and design of interconnection networks have focused
	largely on performance. As these networks get deployed in a wide
	range of new applications, where power is becoming a key design constraint,
	we need to seriously consider power efficiency in designing interconnection
	networks. As the demand for network bandwidth increases, communication
	links, already a significant consumer of power now, will take up
	an ever larger portion of total system power budget. In this paper
	we motivate the use of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) for links, where
	the frequency and voltage of links are dynamically adjusted to minimize
	power consumption. We propose a history-based DVS policy that judiciously
	adjusts link frequencies and voltages based on past utilization.
	Our approach realizes up to 6.3/spl times/ power savings (4.6/spl
	times/ on average). This is accompanied by a moderate impact on performance
	(15.2\% increase in average latency before network saturation and
	2.5\% reduction in throughput.) To the best of our knowledge, this
	is the first study that targets dynamic power optimization of interconnection
	networks.},

  abstract = {Modern Internet services are often implemented as complex, large-scale
	distributed systems. These applications are constructed from collections
	of software modules that may be developed by different teams, perhaps
	in different programming languages, and could span many thousands
	of machines across multiple physical facili- ties. Tools that aid
	in understanding system behavior and reasoning about performance
	issues are invaluable in such an environment.
	
	
	Here we introduce the design of Dapper, Google?s production distributed
	systems tracing infrastructure, and describe how our design goals
	of low overhead, application-level transparency, and ubiquitous deployment
	on a very large scale system were met. Dapper shares conceptual similarities
	with other tracing systems, particularly Magpie [3] and X-Trace [12],
	but certain design choices were made that have been key to its success
	in our environment, such as the use of sampling and restricting the
	instrumentation to a rather small number of common libraries.
	
	
	The main goal of this paper is to report on our experience building,
	deploying and using the system for over two years, since Dapper?s
	foremost measure of success has been its usefulness to developer
	and operations teams. Dapper began as a self-contained tracing tool
	but evolved into a monitoring platform which has enabled the creation
	of many different tools, some of which were not anticipated by its
	designers. We describe a few of the analysis tools that have been
	built using Dapper, share statistics about its usage within Google,
	present some example use cases, and discuss lessons learned so far.},

	research topic. In this paper we present an innovative and automatic
	approach to partitioning with emphasis on correctness. The formalism
	used is occam and the algebraic laws that define its semantics. In
	the proposed approach, the partitioning procedure is characterised
	as a program transformation task and the partitioned system is derived
	from the original description of the system by applying transformation
	rules, all of them proved from the basic laws of occam. A tool has
	been developed to allow the partitioning to be carried out automatically.
	The entire approach is illustrated here through a small case study.},

  title = {A solution to misaligned data access in a vectorizing compiler framework},
  school = {TU Delft},
  year = {2009},
  note = {Code Number CE-MS-2009-31},
  abstract = {Vectorizing code for short vector architectures as employed by today's
	multimedia extensions comes with a number of issues. The responsibilities
	of these issues are moved to the compiler in order to keep hardware
	simple. One of those issues is memory-alignment, which requires the
	compiler to guarantee loading and storing vectors at aligned addresses.
	
	Previous work that covered this issue proposed a mechanism to reorder
	vectors at runtime to ensure proper alignments, while other work
	has focussed on nding a minimal number of reorderings. We combined
	these subjects into an in-depth research and implemented the optimization
	for the retar- getable CoSy{\copyright} compiler framework. Instead
	of solely focussing on the minimal number of reorder- ings, we also
	considered dynamic (runtime) properties which may enable latency-hiding
	of reordering operations. Furthermore, we performed a comparison
	of the presented reordering-techniques and researched the impact
	of other compiler optimizations on the proposed transformation. Finally,
	we placed our results into perspective with unaligned load/store
	operations supplied by our target architecture.
	
	
	With our implementation, we were able to vectorize a number of applications
	for SSE and SSE2 vector extensions where alignment-issues were involved.
	For randomly generated loops we were able to achieve between 50\%
	and 80\% of the speedup obtained by unaligned memory instructions.
	(Our targeted architecture is less strict on memory alignment and
	supplies instructions that can handle misalignments by hardware).
	As for the benchmarks, we were able to achieve speedup factors of
	about 2.25x for a block-matching algorithm (combined with loop versioning
	to avoid runtime alignment), 1.6x for the SPEC95 Swim benchmark and
	a factor 4x for a Sobel FIR filter.},

  abstract = {The current practice of mapping computations to custom hardware implementations
	requires programmers to assume the role of hardware designers. In
	tuning the performance of their hardware implementation, designers
	manually apply loop transformations such as loop unrolling. designers
	manually apply loop transformations. For example, loop unrolling
	is used to expose instruction-level parallelism at the expense of
	more hardware resources for concurrent operator evaluation. Because
	unrolling also increases the amount of data a computation requires,
	too much unrolling can lead to a memory bound implementation where
	resources are idle. To negotiate inherent hardware space-time trade-offs,
	designers must engage in an iterative refinement cycle, at each step
	manually applying transformations and evaluating their impact. This
	process is not only error-prone and tedious but also prohibitively
	expensive given the large search spaces and with long synthesis times.
	This paper describes an automated approach to hardware design space
	exploration, through a collaboration between parallelizing compiler
	technology and high-level synthesis tools. We present a compiler
	algorithm that automatically explores the large design spaces resulting
	from the application of several program transformations commonly
	used in application-specific hardware designs. Our approach uses
	synthesis estimation techniques to quantitatively evaluate alternate
	designs for a loop nest computation. We have implemented this design
	space exploration algorithm in the context of a compilation and synthesis
	system called DEFACTO, and present results of this implementation
	on five multimedia kernels. Our algorithm derives an implementation
	that closely matches the performance of the fastest design in the
	design space, and among implementations with comparable performance,
	selects the smallest design. We search on average only 0.3\% of the
	design space. This technology thus significantly raises the level
	of abstraction for hardware design and explores a design space much
	larger than is feasible for a human designer.},

	synthetic traffic generators can facilitate understanding of traffic

	demands the use of aggressive prefetch algorithms to reduce the effective
	memory access latency. However, prefetching can significantly increase
	memory traffic and unsuccessful prefetches may pollute the cache.
	Metrics such as coverage and accuracy result from a simplistic classification
	of individual prefetches as "good" or "bad." They do not capture
	the full effect of each prefetch and, hence, do not accurately reflect
	the quality of the prefetch algorithm. Gross statistics such as changes
	in the number of misses, total traffic, and IPC are not attributable
	to individual prefetches. Such gross metrics are therefore useful
	only for ranking existing prefetch algorithms; they do not evaluate
	the effect of individual prefetches so that an algorithm might be
	tuned. In this paper, we introduce a new, accurate, and complete
	taxonomy, called the Prefetch Traffic and Miss Taxonomy (PTMT), for
	classifying each prefetch by precisely accounting for the difference
	in traffic and misses it generates, either directly or indirectly.
	We illustrate the use of PTMT by evaluating two data prefetch algorithms.},

	a hardware-supported implementation for realtime applications in
	the framework of an object-based RISC architecture.

  abstract = {Compressed video bitstreams require protection from channel errors
	in a wireless channel. The 3-D set partitioning in hierarchical trees
	(SPIHT) coder has proved its efficiency and its real-time capability
	in the compression of video. A forward-error-correcting (FEC) channel
	(RCPC) code combined with a single automatic-repeat request (ARQ)
	proved to be an effective means for protecting the bitstream. There
	were two problems with this scheme: (1) the noiseless reverse channel
	ARQ may not be feasible in practice and (2) in the absence of channel
	coding and ARQ, the decoded sequence was hopelessly corrupted even
	for relatively clean channels. We eliminate the need for ARQ by making
	the 3-D SPIHT bitstream more robust and resistant to channel errors.
	We first break the wavelet transform into a number of spatio-temporal
	tree blocks which can be encoded and decoded independently by the
	3-D SPIHT algorithm. This procedure brings the added benefit of parallelization
	of the compression and decompression algorithms, and enables implementation
	of region-based coding. We demonstrate the packetization of the bitstream
	and the reorganization of these packets to achieve scalability in
	bit rate and/or resolution in addition to robustness. Then we encode
	each packet with a channel code. Not only does this protect the integrity
	of the packets in most cases, but it also allows detection of packet-decoding
	failures, so that only the cleanly recovered packets are reconstructed.
	In extensive comparative tests, the reconstructed video is shown
	to be superior to that of MPEG-2, with the margin of superiority
	growing substantially as the channel becomes noisier. Furthermore,
	the parallelization makes possible real-time implementation in hardware
	and software},

  abstract = {Your free lunch will soon be over. What can you do about it? What
	are you doing about it. The major processor manufacturers and architectures,
	from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with
	most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance.
	Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput
	ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading
	and multicore architectures. Both of these features are available
	on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current
	PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel
	and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 InStat/MDR Fall Processor
	Forum (http://www.mdronline.com/ fpf04/index.html) was multicore
	devices, with many companies showing new or updated multicore processors.
	Looking back, it's not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of
	multicore. And that puts us at a fundamental turning point in software
	development, at least for the next few years and for applications
	targeting general-purpose desktop computers and low-end servers (which
	happens to account for the vast bulk of the dollar value of software
	sold today). In this article, I describe the changing face of hardware,
	why it suddenly does matter to software, and how it specifically
	matters to you and changes the way you'll likely be writing software
	in the future. Arguably, the free lunch has already been over for
	a year or two, only we're just now noticing.},

	a network on chip (NoC) needs methods to support application performance
	evaluation. Two key aspects these methods have to address are the
	generation and evaluation of network traffic. Traffic generation
	allows injecting packets in the network according to application
	constraint specifications such as transmission rate and end-to-end
	latency. Performance evaluation helps in computing latency and throughput
	at network channels/interfaces, as well as to identify congestion
	and hot-spots. This paper reviews related works in traffic generation
	and performance evaluation for mesh topology NoCs, and proposes general
	methods for both aspects. Three parameters are used here to define
	traffic generation: packet spatial distribution, packet injection
	rate and packet size. Two types of methods to evaluate performance
	in NoCs are discussed: (i) external evaluation, a common strategy
	found in related works, where the network is considered as a black
	box and traffic results are obtained only from the external network
	interfaces; (ii) internal evaluation, where performance is computed
	in each network channel. The paper presents the result of experiments
	conducted in an 8x8 mesh network, varying the routing algorithms
	and the number of virtual channels. The main contribution of this
	work is the set of methods for internal NoC evaluation, which help
	designers to optimize the network under different traffic scenarios.},

	real-time window-based image processing is presented. The architecture
	was specially designed to implement efficiently, both in performance

	real-time constraints. The computational core of the architecture
	is a configurable 2D systolic array of processing elements, which
	can provide throughputs over tenths of Giga Operations per Second
	(GOPs). The architecture employs a novel-addressing scheme that significantly
	reduces the memory access overhead and makes explicit the data parallelism
	at a low temporal storage cost. A specialized processing element,
	called Configurable Window Processor (CWP), was designed to cover
	a broad range of window-based image algorithms. The functionality
	of the CWPs can be modified through configuration registers according
	to a given application. For a current Field Programmable Gate Array
	({FPGA}) prototype of a 7x7 systolic array, the architecture provides
	a throughput of 3.16 GOPs at a 60 MHz clock frequency. The processing
	time for a 7x7 generic window-based image operator on 512x512 gray-level
	images is 8.35 ms. The implemented window-based image operators include
	generic image convolution, gray-level image morphology and template
	matching. According to theoretical and experimental results, the
	architecture compares favorably with other dedicated architectures
	in terms of performance and hardware resource utilization.},

  abstract = {Numerous code optimisation methods are usually experimented by doing
	multiple observations of the initial and the optimised executions
	times in order to declare a speedup. Even with xed input and execution
	environment, programs executions times vary in general. So hence
	dierent kinds of speedups may be reported: the speedup of the average
	execution time, the speedup of the minimal execution time, the speedup
	of the median, etc. Many published speedups in the literature are
	observations of a set of experiments. In order to improve the reproducibility
	of the experimental results, this technical report presents a rigorous
	statistical methodology regarding program performance analysis. We
	rely on well known statistical tests (Shapiro-wilk's test, Fisher's
	F-test, Student's t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney's
	test) to study if the observed speedups are statistically signicant
	or not. By xing 0 < < 1 a desired risk level, we are able to analyse
	the statistical signicance of the average execution time as well
	as the median. We can also check if P [X > Y ] > 1 2 , the probability
	that an individual execution of the optimised code is faster than
	the individual execution of the initial code. Our methodology denes
	a consistent improvement compared to the usual performance analysis
	method in high performance computing as in [15, 11]. We explain in
	each situation what are the hypothesis that must be checked to declare
	a correct risk level for the statistics. The Speedup-Test protocol
	certifying the observed speedups with rigorous statistics is implemented

	could achieve. We have identified two weaknesses in traditional parallelizing
	compilers and propose a novel, integrated approach, resulting in
	significant performance improvements of the generated parallel code.
	Using profile-driven parallelism detection we overcome the limitations
	of static analysis, enabling us to identify more application parallelism

	the traditional target-specific and inflexible mapping heuristics

	strategy against the NAS and SPEC OMP benchmarks and two different
	multi-core platforms (dual quad-core Intel Xeon SMP and dual-socket
	QS20 Cell blade). We demonstrate that our approach not only yields
	significant improvements when compared with state-of-the-art parallelizing

	of manually parallelized codes. On average, our methodology achieves
	96% of the performance of the hand-tuned OpenMP NAS and SPEC parallel

	hardware compiler called Flamel. Ordinary Pascal programs are used
	to define the behavior required of the hardware. Flamel undertakes
	to find parallelism in the program, so it can produce a fast-running
	implementation that meets a user-specified cost bound. A number of
	program transformations create sections of code with more parallel
	computations than the original program has. A novel feature of Flamel
	is a method for organizing the search for the transformations that
	best satisfy the goal. Another new algorithm is one for "expression
	height reduction": rewriting an ensemble of expressions using algebraic
	properties in order to compute the expressions faster. An implementation
	of Flamel has been completed. The output is a description of a datapath
	and a controller, and at a sufficient level of detail so that good
	area and execution time figures can be estimated. On a series of
	tests, Flamel produces implementations of programs that would run
	22 to 200 times faster than an MC68000 running the same programs,
	if the clock cycles were the same. The tests also show that a wide
	range of time-area tradeoffs are produced by varying the area constraint.},

	These KPNs express the signal processing applications in a parallel

	silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide circuit, fabricated through
	bonding technology. The theoretical model was tested by fitting it
	to the lasing characteristics obtained for fabricated devices, which
	we presented previously. A good fit was obtained using parameter
	values that are consistent with numerical simulation. To obtain optimized
	laser performance, the composition of the InP-based epitaxial layer
	structure was optimized to minimize internal optical loss for a structure
	compatible with efficient current injection. Specific attention was
	paid to a tunnel-junction based approach. Bending loss was quantified
	to estimate the minimum microdisk diameter. The coupling between
	the InP microdisk and Si waveguide was calculated as function of
	the bonding layer thickness, waveguide offset and waveguide width.
	To study the lateral injection efficiency, an equivalent electrical
	network was solved and the voltage-current characteristic was calculated.
	Based on these results, the dominant device parameters were identified,
	including microdisk thickness and radius, coupling loss and tunnel-junction
	p-type doping. These parameters were optimized to obtain maximum
	wall-plug efficiency, for output powers in the range 1-100 W. The

	clock gating, dynamic sleep transistors, and body-bias techniques.
	In a 65-nm eight-metal CMOS process, the 275 mm2 custom design contains

	stated attributes, we present a new programming paradigm, a new instruction
	set architecture, a microcode-based microarchitecture, and a compiler
	methodology. The programming paradigm, in contrast with the conventional
	programming paradigms, allows general-purpose conventional code and
	hardware descriptions to coexist in a program: In our proposal, for
	a given instruction set architecture, a onetime instruction set extension
	of eight instructions, is sufficient to implement the reconfigurable
	functionality of the processor. We propose a microarchitecture based
	on reconfigurable hardware emulation to allow high-speed reconfiguration
	and execution. To prove the viability of the proposal, we experimented
	with the MPEG-2 encoder and decoder and a Xilinx Virtex II Pro {FPGA}.
	We have implemented three operations, SAD, DCT, and IDCT. The overall
	attainable application speedup for the MPEG-2 encoder and decoder

	Depending on the parallelism profile, the MAN may be optimized for

	building blocks. SOMA has been successfully integrated into an automated

  abstract = {iscc is an interactive tool for manipulating special kinds of sets
	of integer tuples and binary relations over such sets. In particular,
	all constraints in the descriptions of the sets and relations have
	to be affine (linear + constant), but may involve parameters and
	existentially quantified variables. A distinguishing feature of iscc
	is that it provides a cardinality operation on sets and relations
	that computes a symbolic expression (in terms of the parameters and
	domain variables) for the number of elements in the set or the image
	of the relation. These expressions are piecewise quasipolynomials,
	which can be further manipulated in iscc. Besides basic operations
	on sets and piecewise quasipolynomials, iscc also provides an interface
	to code generation, lexicographic optimization, dependence analysis,
	transitive closures and the symbolic computation of upper bounds
	and sums of piecewise quasipolynomials over their domains. This tutorial
	does not involve any theory, but instead introduces some concepts
	and operations through examples. These operations are then combined
	to solve a small number of non-trivial problems. All examples are
	inspired by the polyhedral model for program analysis and transformation.
	No prior knowledge of this model is required. As most of the operations
	supported by iscc take abstract integer sets or related objects as
	input, they should also be useful outside this context.},

  abstract = {The geometrical model is a powerful tool for program analysis and
	optimization and forms the basis on which we build the two parts
	of this dissertation, a methodology for incremental loop transformations
	and an efficient enumeration technique for parametric integer sets.
	Power consumption for typical embedded multi-media applications is
	dominated by the storage of and the access to the large multi-dimensional
	arrays they manipulate. It is now well known that a design methodology
	for reducing power consumption and improving system performance should
	apply global loop transformations for increasing locality and regularity
	of data accesses. In the first part of this dissertation, we propose
	a two-step global loop transformation approach consisting of a linear
	transformation focusing mainly on regularity, and a translation focusing
	on locality. We further develop a refined regularity criterion and
	show how to perform the translation step incrementally, allowing
	multiple complicated cost functions to be evaluated. Many compiler
	optimization techniques depend on the enumeration of parametric integer
	sets defined by linear equations. In the second part of this dissertation,
	we present the first implementation of Barvinok's algorithm applied
	to the enumeration of parametric polytopes, extending an earlier
	implementation of this algorithm for a subclass of the enumeration
	problems we consider, and providing a significant improvement over
	another implementation based on a different technique. The resulting
	enumerator may be obtained as an explicit function or as a generating
	function. We further show that these two representations are polynomially
	interconvertible and we discuss some approaches for handling generalized
	enumeration problems.},

	---------------------------------------
	
	1 Introduction
	
	(# Loop trafos [1], [4], [26])
	
	Challenging problems require compound trafos
	
	
	Previously used techniques:
	
	- Decide order of trafos a priori --> inadequate: desirability of
	trafo cannot be evaluated locally, one step at a time
	
	- Generate and test: Explore all different possible combinatinos of
	trafos
	
	 - Some combinations of trafos may lead to same behavior
	
	 - Some trafos come in infinite variations...
	
	
	Alternative:
	
	(# Loop interchange, reversal, skewing modelled as linear trafos [7],
	[8], [12], [13], [19], [21])
	
	Polyhedral loop has n - 1 degrees of parallelism [13]###, data locality
	in all loop dimensions [24]
	
	--> not usable for general loop nests with sequential loops --> commonly
	used: direction vectors [2], [26]
	
	--> solved here --> easy determination of legality of compound trafo
	
	
	Algos to improve parallelism and data locality.
	
	Even for simple systems compound trafos for data locality may be necessary
	[9, 10, 17].
	
	Optimal (compound) trafo without exhaustive search.
	
	Implemented in SUIF.
	
	
	2 Loop Transformations on Distance Vectors
	
	(# Survey of use of DisV-Loop trafos: [20])
	
	
	2.A Loop Nest Representation 
	
	(# Techniques for extracting DisVs from loops: [12, 16, 22])
	
	
	2.B Unimodular transformations
	
	Three elementary trafos:
	
	- Permutation
	
	- Reversal
	
	- Skewing --> Lower triangular UM matrix
	
	
	UM := { M | ^* M /in Z^(nxn) 
	
	 ^* |M| /in {-1, 1} } 
	
	 = { Unimodular Matrices }
	
	ForAll (a, b): UM^(2) . a * b /in UM
	
	ForAll a: UM . a^(-1) /in UM
	
	
	Compound trafo matrix: Product of constructing matrices
	
	
	2.C Legality of Unimodalr Transformations
	
	
	Trafo = legal == Loop nest can be sequentially executed in lexicographical
	order
	
	
	T2.1: D = { dist vects } --> trafo T = legal == ForAll d : D . Td
	>lex 0
	
	
	Fully permutable loops: Any permutation allowed
	
	
	3 Parallelizing Loops with Distance Vectors
	
	n-deep DisV-loops have (n - 1) degrees of parallelism [13]
	
	
	3.A Canonical Form: A Fully Permutable Loop Nest
	
	DisV-loops always transformable to fully permutable loop nest via
	skewing (T3.1)
	
	
	3.B Parallelization
	
	3.B.1 Finest Granularity of Parallelism 
	
	Wavefront trafo
	
	- Skew innermost loop with all other loops
	
	- Interchange all loops in a cyclic way, making the innermost loop
	the outermost loop
	
	--> DOALL loops as innermost loops
	
	
	3.B.2 Coarsest Granularity of Parallelism
	
	Outermost parallel loops possible if DVs do not span iteration space
	(in full dimensionality) [14]
	
	3.B.3 Tiling to Reduce Synchronization

  abstract = {Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been heavily studied and developed
	in various scientific and engineering fields. Its multiresolution
	and locality nature facilitates applications requiring progressiveness
	and capturing high-frequency details. However, when dealing with
	enormous data volume, its performance may drastically reduce. On
	the other hand, with the recent advances in consumer-level graphics
	hardware, personal computers nowadays usually equip with a graphics
	processing unit (GPU) based graphics accelerator which offers SIMD-based
	parallel processing power. This paper presents a SIMD algorithm that
	performs the convolution-based DWT completely on a GPU, which brings
	us significant performance gain on a normal PC without extra cost.
	Although the forward and inverse wavelet transforms are mathematically
	different, the proposed algorithm unifies them to an almost identical
	process that can be efficiently implemented on GPU. Different wavelet
	kernels and boundary extension schemes can be easily incorporated
	by simply modifying input parameters. To demonstrate its applicability
	and performance, we apply it to wavelet-based geometric design, stylized
	image processing, texture-illuminance decoupling, and JPEG2000 image
	encoding},

	of magnitude slower than the hardware they simulate. Hence, most

	truncated benchmark simulations that are often inaccurate and misleading.
	We present the sampling microarchitecture simulation (SMARTS) framework
	as an approach to enable fast and accurate performance measurements
	of full-length benchmarks. SMARTS accelerates simulation by selectively
	measuring in detail only an appropriate benchmark subset. SMARTS
	prescribes a statistically sound procedure for configuring a systematic
	sampling simulation run to achieve a desired quantifiable confidence
	in estimates. Analysis of 41 of the 45 possible SPEC2K benchmark/
	input combinations show CPI and energy per instruction (EPI) can
	be estimated to within 3\% with 99.7\% confidence by measuring fewer
	than 50 million instructions per benchmark. In practice, inaccuracy
	in micro-architectural state initialization introduces an additional
	uncertainty which we empirically bound to /spl sim/2\% for the tested
	benchmarks. Our implementation of SMARTS achieves an actual average
	error of only 0.64\% on CPI and 0.59\% on EPI for the tested benchmarks,
	running with average speedups of 35 and 60 over detailed simulation
	of 8-way and 16-way out-of-order processors, respectively.},

	on a real-life motion estimation application. The results obtained
	for this application show power reductions of about 85% for the memory
	subsystem compared to the case without a custom memory hierarchy.

	The automatically generated VHDL is compared to a manually crafted

	in Xilinx ISE 6.3i and the reported results are obtained from the
	actual execution on the {MOLEN} poly-
	
	morphic processor. Even though the automatically generated VHDL does
	not contain any optimizations, speedup
	
	of 7 is observed. However, compared to manually tuned VHDL, there
	is still a difference of several orders of magni-
	
	tude. This paper will explore the differences that explain the performance
	gap and identify sources of improvement
	
	and necessary optimizations that have to be implemented. Some of the

	from logic synthesis to the design of discrete controllers. We cast
	the problem as solving abstract equations over languages and study
	the most general solutions under the synchronous and parallel composition
	operators. We also specialize such language equations to languages
	associated with important classes of automata used for modeling systems,
	e.g., regular languages as counterparts of finite automata, FSM languages
	as counterparts of FSMs. Thus we can operate algorithmically on those
	languages through their automata and study how to solve effectively
	their language equations. We investigate the maximal subsets of solutions
	closed with respect to various language properties. In particular,
	we investigate classes of the largest compositional solutions (defined
	by properties exhibited by the composition of the solution and of
	the context). We provide the first algorithm to compute the largest
	compositionally progressive solution of synchronous equations. This
	approach unifies in a seamless frame previously reported techniques.
	As an application we solve the classical problem of synthesizing
	a converter between a mismatched pair of protocols, using their specifications,
	as well as those of the channel and of the required service.},

	concepts - scalable film optical link multichip-module (S-FOLM),
	three-dimensional (3-D) microoptical switching system (3D-MOSS),
	and self-organized lightwave network (SOLNET)-is proposed. The feasibility
	of SELMOS for board-level reconfigurable optical interconnects is
	studied by the beam propagation method/finite difference time domain
	simulation focusing on three key issues; reducing size/cost of electrical
	to optical (E-O) and optical to electrical (O-E) signal conversion
	devices, tolerating alignment accuracy for optical coupling, and
	miniaturizing high-speed massive optical switching. S-FOLM, which
	consists of film-waveguide-based 3-D structures with embedded optoelectronic
	active elements and optical Z-connections for interplane links, enables
	drastic size/cost reduction of E-O and O-E conversion devices. 3D-MOSS,
	which is an S-FOLM with embedded microoptical switches, has a potentiality
	of 1024 /spl times/ 1024 switching with a system size of /spl sim/1.4
	/spl times/ 0.6 cm/sup 2/ and an insertion loss of 29 dB. The switching
	rate of the 3D-MOSS is determined by the heat releasing speed to
	be /spl sim/2 /spl times/ 10/sup 5/ 1/s when PLZT waveguide-prism-deflector
	microoptical switches are used. By using advanced electrooptic materials,
	rates higher than 10/sup 8/ 1/s are expected. Twenty-five percent
	misalignment in waveguide assembly raises the insertion loss of the
	3D-MOSS to 73 dB. The loss is reduced to 32 dB in SELMOS-based 3D-MOSS,
	where a self-organized 3-D microoptical network is implemented using
	SOLNET. Further loss reduction is expected by structural optimization
	of loss-inducing parts. Thus, SELMOS is found to be a solution of
	the three key issues for board-level reconfigurable optical interconnects.
	In addition, photolithographic packaging with selectively occupied
	repeated transfer (PL-Pack with SORT), which integrates different
	types of active elements into one substrate in desired arrangements
	using an all-photolithographic process, can contribute to cost and
	the coefficient of thermal expansion-mismatching reduction.},

  abstract = {Impulse is a memory system architecture that adds an optional level
	of address indirection at the memory controller. Applications can
	use this level of indirection to remap their data structures in memory.
	As a result, they can control how their data is accessed and cached,
	which can improve cache and bus utilization. The Impulse design does
	not require any modification to processor, cache, or bus designs
	since all the functionality resides at the memory controller. As
	a result, Impulse can be adopted in conventional systems without
	major system changes. We describe the design of the Impulse architecture
	and how an Impulse memory system can be used in a variety of ways
	to improve the performance of memory-bound applications. Impulse
	can be used to dynamically create superpages cheaply, to dynamically
	recolor physical pages, to perform strided fetches, and to perform
	gathers and scatters through indirection vectors. Our performance
	results demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimizations in a
	variety of scenarios. Using Impulse can speed up a range of applications
	from 20 percent to over a factor of 5. Alternatively, Impulse can
	be used by the OS for dynamic superpage creation; the best policy
	for creating superpages using Impulse outperforms previously known
	superpage creation policies},

	in 3D wavelet coding to further exploit temporal correlations across

	macroblock can motion align from forward and/or backward for temporal
	wavelet de-composition. In each direction, a macroblock may select
	its partition from one of seven modes - 16x16, 8x16, 16x8, 8x8, 8x4,
	4x8 and 4x4 - to allow accurate motion alignment. Furthermore, the
	rate-distortion optimization criterions are proposed to select motion
	mode, motion vectors and partition mode. Although the proposed technique
	greatly improves the accuracy of motion alignment, it does not directly
	bring the coding efficiency gain because of smaller block size and
	more block boundaries. Therefore, an overlapped block motion alignment
	is further proposed to cope with block boundaries and to suppress
	spatial high-frequency components. The experimental results show
	the proposed adaptive block-size motion alignment with the over apped
	block motion alignment can achieve up to 1.0 dB gain in 3D wavelet
	video coding. Our 3D wavelet coder outperforms the MC-EZBC for most

	in other words, the execution of programs can be partitioned into
	segments of execution, during which the application exhibits unique
	architectural properties. This property has been used for various
	optimization goals. In addition, phase information is utilized to
	reduce the run time of the architectural simulation. Conventionally,
	an application is examined in an architecture-independent manner
	(such as the number of times a basic block is executed) to extract
	information about the phases and then only the representative execution
	intervals are executed to analyze architectural choices. We claim
	that such approaches are becoming inadequate in the many-core era
	as application execution is not dominated by the instructions only,
	but instead the communication structure of the application is becoming
	as important as the instruction behavior. Hence, we propose to utilize
	communication behavior to determine the phases of an application.
	Our results reveal that the inclusion of the communication information
	can increase the accuracy of the phase detection significantly. Specifically,
	for SPLASH2 and Mine-Bench applications, the average (geometric mean)
	CPI error rate with the instruction-based phase detection is 11.01%,
	while our phase detection scheme has an average error rate of 3.41%

  abstract = {Recent impressive performance improvements in computer architecture
	have not led to significant gains in the case of debugging. Software
	debugging often relies on inserting run-time software checks. In
	many cases, however, it is hard to find the root cause of a bug.
	Moreover, program execution typically slows down significantly, often
	by 10?100 times. To address this problem, this paper introduces
	the intelligent watcher (iWatcher), a novel architectural scheme
	to monitor dynamic execution automatically, flexibly, and with minimal
	overhead. iWatcher associates program-specified monitoring functions
	with memory locations. When any such location is accessed, the monitoring
	function is automatically triggered with low overhead. To further
	reduce overhead and support rollback, iWatcher can optionally leverage
	thread-level peculation (TLS). The iWatcher architecture can be used
	to detect various bugs, including buffer overflow, accessing freed
	locations, memory leaks, stack-smashing and value-invariant violations.
	To evaluate iWatcher, we use seven applications with various real
	and injected bugs. Our results show that iWatcher detects many more
	software bugs than Valgrind, a well-known open-source bug detector.
	Moreover, iWatcher only induces a 0.1?179% execution overhead,
	which is orders of magnitude less than Valgrind. Our sensitivity
	study shows that even with 20% of the dynamic loads monitored in
	a program, iWatcher adds only 72?182% overhead. Finally, TLS is
	effective at reducing overheads for programs with substantial monitoring.},

	Schlegel diagrams, shellability, Gale transforms, and oriented matroids)
	- discuss important examples and elegant constructions (cyclic and
	neighborly polytopes, zonotopes, Minkowski sums, permutahedra and
	associhedra, fiber polytopes, and the Lawrence construction) - show
	the excitement of current work in the field (Kalai's new diameter
	bounds, construction of non-rational polytopes, the Bohne-Dress tiling
	theorem, the upper-bound theorem), and nonextendable shellings) They
	should provide interesting and enjoyable reading for researchers

	applications written in Matlab onto reconfigurable platforms, such
	as {FPGA}s. COMPAAN rewrites the original Matlab application as a
	process network in which the control is parameterized and distributed.
	This control is given as parameterized polytopes that are expressed
	in terms of pseudo-linear expressions. These expressions cannot always
	be mapped efficiently onto hardware as they contain multiplication
	and integer division operations. This obstructs the data flow through
	the processes. Therefore, we present in this paper the expression
	compiler that efficiently maps pseudo-linear expressions onto a dedicated
	hardware data-path in such a way that the distributed and parameterized
	control never obstructs the data flow through processors. This compiler
	employs techniques like number theory axioms, method of difference,
	and predicated static single assignment code.},

	Compaan/Laura that allows us to do fast mapping of applications written
	in Matlab onto reconfigurable platforms, such as {FPGA}s, using IP
	cores to implement the data-path of the applications. A particular
	characteristic of the derived networks is the existence of selfloops.
	These selfloops have a large impact on the utilization of IP cores
	in the final hardware implementation of a Process Network (PN), especially
	if the IP cores are deeply pipelined. In this paper, we present an
	exploration methodology that uses feedback provided by the Laura
	tool to increase the utilization of IP cores embedded in our PN.
	Using this exploration, we go from 60MFlops to 1,7GFlops for the
	QR algorithm using the same number of resources except for memory.},
